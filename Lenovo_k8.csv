"After using this phone for a month or so, I realize that I actually downgraded from Lenovo K4 note to Lenovo K8 Note. Why is it that the newer versions of phones be deprecated with smart features existing in older phones ?? All the 'Feature phone' options from K4 are missing in K8 - that's pathetic. Inbetween acquisitions (Moto & Lenovo), why is that you want to change Lenovo phone UI to use the Moto ?? That's very disappointing. I'm a Lenovo fan for UI and I go for Lenovo phone. If I were Moto fan I would go for Moto phone. Moto UI is very rigid and no options to change the style. For ex. the Video files are displyed in list format, not a preview big images as in Lenovo K4. Please please Lenovo consider this. Now I'm planning to change phone to other. Levnovo can you please list out what all features have to taken out from K4 to K8 ?? This is very disappointing experience. You say the turbo charger, charge phone in few mins... but even after 1/2 hr of charging I see only 4-5 % increase at times !!",24 Nov 2018,Won't suggest Lenovo mobile...,2.0 ,Kiran Kumar

"One of the worst phone I ever used, giving so individual powerful parts Lenovo still couldn't give a combined powerful performance. Heats up like anything while charging or playing game, the heating is such high that the screen starts lagging. After Oreo update performance has found again a new low. Battery is is also poor when low battery alert comes at 15% it reaches to 0 in 2-3 minutes (yes just 2-3 minutes), after using this phone for 9 months sometime touch screen problem starts happening. At top left the screen got some yellow patches. Highly disappointed with Lenovo. Maybe my handset is faulty in one of hundred sets but this is all what I keep facing",04 Nov 2018,Worst mobile handset I used ever,2.0 ,brij patel
PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS LENOVO MOBILES IN THIS THE COMPANY REGULARLY PROVIDES THE UPDATES AND ALSO GIVE SUCH UPDATES THAT AFTER THE GUARANTEE PERIOD IF YOU UPDATE THEN THE PHONE WILL GET DAMAGE IN SUCH AS WAY THAT THE SERVICE CENTER WILL GIVE US THE REASON THAT YOU PHONE IS DAMAGE BY WATER. I HAD FACED THIS PROBLEM EXACTLY AFTER A YEAR EVEN AFTER CONTACTING THE COMPANY DIRECTLY THEY DO NOT ACCEPT INSPITE THE INSTRUMENT IS CLEAN AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF DAMAGE THEY ARE SAYING IT IT IS DAMAGE BY WATER AND NEED TO CHANGE THE MOTHER BOARD AND THE COST IS EQUAL TO THE COST OF NEW MOBILE. THAT IS ALSO THEY ARE GIVING AT CONCESSIONAL RATES. SO I WOULD SUGGEST NOT TO BUY THE LENOVO PRODUCTS.,20 Jan 2019,COMPANY SERVICE IS WORST AND ALL SERVICE CENTERES ARE GUIDED HOW TO CHEAT CUSTOMERS,1.0 ,rajesh ganeriwal
I had used Lenovo Vibe phone in the past and i was really impressed with that product. but K8 Note has broke all my expectation. I am really disappointed and can't return as return date got closed in 10 days. I was under impression of 1 month return policy :( 1. Cast feature is not working. 2. headphone plug works sometime but if you unplugged it stop working again. 3. if you watch anything long time on your phone you get strain in eyes which is really not good.,30 Sep 2018,Not a good product,1.0 ,Rauf
"This is the most amazing phone I've seen in this price range!! It should be more costly but it's not! It's totally cheap. It's camera, performance, screen quality, picture quality, sound clarity is amazing and too good to be true! Trust me I'm using this phone since a years now, and it works totally fine till now, it has given me no problems what so ever! This is the first phone having decca core (10 core) processer. So great for multitasking and gaming! with Dolby Atmos for amazing clarity and surround sound!

"Writing this review after 1year of purchase. Pros: 1. 5.5 inch full screen 2. 4000 mah battery 3. Decent touch screen response Cons: 1. Although they say it as 10core processor, 4gb ram. I see device gets heated while playing PUBG game. And screen frame rate nd resolution little low while playing game. But game doesn't stuck much anyways 2. Stock Android is one benefit for device being faster in response. At same time lesser customization and also not much utility apps available out of box , apart from Android one's 3. At times my home screen gadget clock time don't get updated. It's a clear bad bug. Yet times I was mistaken watching time on my device.",22 Sep 2018,Ok purchase.

"Excellent display, super fast charging, great feel ad very fast. Easily handles many apps open at the same time and heating issues are not a bother too. Sound is nice but beware it has only 1 speaker although there are two grills on the body of the phone. Can't understand why Lenovo did this . The phone has already got latest Oreo update, along with enhancements to sound, performance and camera. Camera is great at this price band. The biggest issue is that it does not support dual 4G Standby as described in the specs. Only one SIM will become 4G while the other will shift to 3G/2G. That is ridiculous. I bought it on seeing the features shown on the product page saying ""Dual 4G Dual Standby"", however its a total disappointment there. Should have put proper description. Overall a very good phone if you take away the negatives regarding dual standby and speakers.",05 Oct 2018,It doesn't support dual 4G Standby.One SIM will become 4G while the other will shift to 3G/2G.,4.0 ,Vipul
"So apparently, if your charger cable degrades, you have to shell out Rs 1500 to replace your Mobile Charging port too. Why you ask? Because they can not connect phone to PC using ""broken"" cable (Not any other working cable, because that is against their Policy), so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty.

"It has been more than 1 year and 4 months using this phone. Brought this phone at 14k. Specifications looked good. First 6 month it was decent phone. Just when it was about to complete 6 month Turbo Charger didn't worked. Lucikly it was within exact 6 month it got replaced for free. Then after couple of months came the Oreo update and phone battery started draining very quickly. Lenovo gave another update after 15-20 days which solved the issue. But still there are bluetooth, wifi connectivity issue. I cant use wireless bluetooth headphones because of lag in it. Then just 2 days ago phone got hanged and is not able to start. After visiting service center they told me its software issue and we dont have update for it you need to wait 15 - 20 days. So till i dont get update its useless phone. Also, this phone price is today is around 30 % down and max is 3k so very little value on exchange of phone. So my final call will be dont buy it. Edit : Update after 1 month later I was told its mother board had issue. I was surprised to hear this because it never had fallen no physical damage then how motherboard gets issue. You need to pay Rs. 8000 but we would suggest buy new phone instead which will cost around same. Today 02 Jun 2019, i got notification from Amazon that my review has been voted by 10 people. Thats why I am updating my review. After reading reviews i found many are facing same issue of motherboard and phone hangs and shows Lenovo logo. So I would really suggest dont fall for trap of avg rating of 3.4. If we could give 0 as rating then avg would fall below 2. 43 percent of people have given 3 or below 3. I feel number of 4 and 5 is higher because people immediately review it after purchase they dont wait for at least 1 year to check the quality. So my really request would be dont buy this cheap quality phone.",02 Dec 2018,Dont buy it. Zero stars. Cheap Quality Product. Motherboard failing without any physical damage.,1.0 ,Amazaon Customer

And said, to install an app to check the performance, and at last said it's the performance problem, so it can't be taken back.. good and happy to hear and at last wasted the money. The main purpose i booked this mobile even though out dated version is for dolby atoms sound system, and for few other expected features but not satisfied, and just waiting few days or month to pass to exchange...

I previously owned Lenovo K6 power. And I was very happy with that phone. thinking the same I bought K8 Note and Its a disappointment.

"Got this Mobile on 18-03-2019. I could say this mobile is quite ok. cons Battery back: Back is not good. (average net use you will get 10 to 12 hrs max). If you keep the phone idle without using data, calling the battery will drain in 1.5 days. Charging time: Full charge it requires 3 hours in spite of using a turbocharger. Camera: The worst camera and the clarity of the camera is not good. Pros 1) Phone in good budget range if you are looking for 4gb Ram with 64 internal memory specifications Overall : My suggestion it is better for any one to opt for other mobiles since we have issues with battery and camera",22 Mar 2019,Battery backup is ok.

This was the worst choice anyone would ever make. One software update made the entire phone go 'crazy'. The fingerprint reader and power button started responding late.

I am writing this review after using this smartphone for about 14 months. This phone has so much features no doubt. Everything sets into place at the given price. But the problem is that company gives only one year warranty for repair at service centres. And my phone's motherboard got damsged at just after one year and two months. I am very much disappointed the quality of motherboard used in this phone. Very worse. I sold the scrap dead phone at The Lenovo service at just 1k RS.

"Being a brand, people expect minimum quality without any heating issues , hanging issues.I brought Lenovo K8 note...I wonder there is no gallery,call recording option and some others which are basic needs ...the phone looks like it was built 10 years back where there were no much basic options to the users the company has to deeply look at this issue if u want to sustain in the market...mobile is getting heat just for phone calls that too for the brain new one...Lenovo is not looking at peoples health ...while taking call ear is feeling heat and pain other China companies are far better than Lenovo,it's better to shutdown your mobile services if ur not looking for basics things ...I have spend 10000 Rs on this mobile now I am unable to replace it or unable to get back my money ...even I have replaced with the same new phone ,I faced heating issues...this is serious issue...my hard earned money 10,000 got wasted....

My experience with the office suite has also been quite nice although as expected using Word drains the battery a bit faster than the other apps. There have been reports of swift battery drainage on this smartphone and initially after the Oreo 8.0.0 update i faced a similar problem for a short while but the problem resolved itself within a few days and especially after i updated my whatsapp. Now after charging the battery to 100% i can use my phone for almost two entire days.

"Bought this mobile in Jan'18. Initially performance was good but after Oreo update battery performance was pathetic. Battery drains very very fast and last 15% goes in just 15 seconds. I asked for support from customer care and as guided by them I visited their service center wherein they did something (not to mention that I lost all the data during this process) and told me that now it will work fine. But in reality nothing improved, battery still drains very fast, specially last 15%. If I'm watching online video last 15% drains in just 3-4 seconds, if I'm on call then it takes approximately 7 seconds to drain, if I'm working online then it runs for 10 seconds and if I keep it idle it takes maximum 15 seconds to fully drain. My personal recommendation is to avoid this mobile set for good. One more thing to add here, Net won't work on any other mobile / laptop if we share Net through its Hotspot. Other handset's / laptop's WiFi will detect and connect to this handset's Hotspot but no matter what you do Net will not run on other mobile / laptop.",26 Dec 2018,"Strongly ""Not Recommend"" ‚Äî Major Battery and Hotspot Issue",1.0 ,Abhishek Nautiyal

"Its been like a month since I bought this phone. The device is really worth its price. But when you compare it to the similar variants, it has a few draw backs. First of all, lets talk about the plus points. The screen resolution is really great with the 401 dpi/ppi resolution FHD screen. Also the touch sensitivity is really awesome too.The fingerprint sensor is the advanced type, with a quick recognition system, and you can add upto five different finger prints. The camera quality is also great with front selfie flash and back blash , with the depth enabled mode, the pictures can run upto 12MB for one picture. The 13+5 MP rear camera and 13 MP front camera is really satisfying. The corning edges is quites2 a thing for its design quality. The screen is scratch resistant and the device is water spill proof. the charging port is quite rigid and the charger fits right with no discrepancies. The device comes with its own back cover which is also good. The notification lights on the device can be adjusted for your preference. During the first weeks, the device was having such a great battery backup and later on it began to drop. Even though the product comes with 4000 mAh battery, It canonly be used for upto 7 hours full browsing on the net, or one whole day normal use. the device has a slight heating problem during browsing, but does not heat up while watching videos or calling. it even doesnt heat up while charging. The deca core processor is really promising with quick launching of applications and fast computing. The device also provides split screen.The 4 GB RAM is really useful and 64 GB ROM is quite enough for a normal usage. During ma experience , after using some certain applications on the device. I have found out that Instagram crashes while using. It also comes with a music key, which can be assigned for any quick functions like turning on flash light or quick play music etc. In my opinion the product is really worth its price and the user interface is user friendly with advanced features.",20 Nov 2018,Worth the price,4.0 ,Gowtham krishna R

"I hadn't had any phone working this good after an year. But, there are few pros and cons which I will elaborate : Pros :- 1. Never hangs- The 10core processor and stock Android performs excellently. 2. Battery Life-changing Even after an year, the battery performance is decent. It doesn't drain out. 3. Camera-The photos are decent and the secondary camera does perform very well in daylight or proper lighting conditions. 4.Build quality-This is the best thing. I have honestly thrown the phone many times(even screen facing), but there is not a single sent or damage on it. 4.Timely upgrades-Lenovo does offer timely upgrades for this phone. Cons:- 1.Heating issue-The phone does heat up when playing heavy games (like PUBG) but it is still manageable. 2.Camera-The low light performance is not satisfactory. You notice grains and color difference. The depth effect is really bad I must say. 3.The back panel-The back panel is aluminium and is very slippery. Cannot imagine the phone without using a cover as it can easily slip. Overall, I haven't been bored of this phone yet. And even after 14+ months of using, I think there is no good competitor for it in 10k price range. It still beats many.
