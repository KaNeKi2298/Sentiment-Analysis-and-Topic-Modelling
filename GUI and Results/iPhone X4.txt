the battery life was better than previous iphones but cannot take the competition from other phone available in the market it gives you one day(15 hrs approx) backup with moderate usage, it catches scratch very easily specially on its metal rim, screen was awesome, sound is also superb, camera is not upto mark, too much heating issues after upgrading ios 12.1. not a value for money.

my recommendation: avoid apple products, rather go for samsung or huawei or one plus, as they provide better service than this $1 trillion company who just bilks money out of everyone.
