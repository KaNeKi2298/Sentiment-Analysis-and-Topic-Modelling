cons- - battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage i feel is a bit disappointing.
Score is: -0.81

this is my first iphone i was a long time android user but after using this iphone my views have been completely changed for androids after using ios or iphone i have realised that iphone is much better than android in terms of display,camera,speed the iphone works seamless i mean the speed is very good the battery is okay if you dont play games the battery will run for a whole day in a single charge 2-the camera is mind blowing 3- the phone processor speed is great cons 1- the battery drains fast when you play games or if you keep bright display light then also battery will not be able to keep it for a whole day
Score is: 0.9773

the battery life was better than previous iphones but cannot take the competition from other phone available in the market it gives you one day(15 hrs approx) backup with moderate usage, it catches scratch very easily specially on its metal rim, screen was awesome, sound is also superb, camera is not upto mark, too much heating issues after upgrading ios 12.1. not a value for money.

- apple thankfully has taken care of the the battery which is indeed much better then its predecessors, a single charge of 100% in my case stayed easily for around 10-12 hrs, which in iphone 6 used to be 6-8hrs [i do not have to carry my charger any more :) ] - the hd clarity of the screen is to die for so crisp and super vibrant, the speaker quality is loud and sharp even with full volume there is no jarring sound.

* great display * ergonomic design * excellent camera from apple * great battery life ( charge time is a factor ) * no lagging issues * similar to iphone xs only difference is a12 chip in xs and a11 in x * great buy from prime sale with display insurance from amazon perk if you are an apple lover like me and you want to upgrade from older versions of iphone at the same time similar look as 2019 xs then this is your best choice.

the original iphone x is still considered one of the best smartphones ever made,even after a successor xs has launched,it is still a better buy as the processor in iphone x is literally much faster than any android phones out there so speed is not a query ,battery life still seems reasonable ,and the display is so crisp and awesome even with that huge notch ,face id works greats although a dedicated fingerprint sensor would be nice ,my final verdict iphone x is still a great buy compared to iphone xs and xr due to its drop in price ,but the better choice is this https://www.amazon.in/gp/offer-listing/b0711t2l8k/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeasin=b0711t2l8k&linkcode=am2&tag=techstore01-21&linkid=a58094adb066087bad018f471672e0e7
