it is a very good choice on a small budget. i tell you why... screen - ips screen with hd+ (720*1440) display , it looks very nice easy to read in day light. note - mobile screen has round shape (but screen shot has corners , idk how) battery - i have submitted screen shots about battery uses (it is without sim card) it took 19 hours, from 100 percent to 81 percent (with screen on 33 minutes and with no sim card) so in my opinion battery is decent enough for a day use camera - i have submitted the photo sample . you can check in ti photos . these photos are taken in day light camera is good for day light shooting. sound sound quality is good, in speaker as well as in earphone (earphone is not provided with handset) phone speaker is loud enough to fill a room os and ui comes with android version 8.1 😊 ui is great , easy to understand. it comes with some unnecessary pre-loaded apps which can be deleted (but not the mi apps) network calling i have used it in whatsapp calling only and the voice clarity was good, no issue. i will update my review after 1-2 weeks of use . recommended ? yes, best smart phone according to the budget.

well to be honest m disappointed with mi this time and m shocked actually. i have used mi devices a lot. redmi note 3, note 5, and so on and currently have mi max 2 as well but this tiny phone redmi 6a is a big let down. reasons below 1.the advanced beauty selfie mode with so called ai sucks until its bright sunlight daylight outside so the selfie lovers this is ain't a phone or a camera for selfish lovers in low light cabs pub bars etc for selfie lovers. 2.heating issue while charging is annoying. especially with power bank in traveling in hand or pocket or even bike or car. 3.the unlocking screen thing is not smooth i have to swipe up multiple times not sure why or if its a problem with my cheap screen guard tempered glass unless the same dowrks fine with ny other devices 4.inky good thing is the speaker output and the sound. just brilliant. awsome 5.tiny style with good grip slim look and as a secondary phone or a phone for standard smartphone users and aslo for people with a little high age like people above 50s will be a great phone. 6.battery backup is fine for a day with 4g and wifi fibuse at home. 7.thenese and scustomizations level as usual awesome. 8/neteork is fine and called voice quality is good too. 9.balcony color is good just that the finger print sensor would have made much more sense. 10.most importantly extra memory card slot saves you and also that 2 gb ram is not adequate.

brought this mobile for my mom. manily purchased it keeping budget in mind and my mom's a ability to handle a smart phone. not regreting too much since the user is amateur. but, if you are an advanced user or a gamer kindly avoid this phone. there are few more options available if you can able to add few more thousands to your budget. build quality is okay display is okay, not that great. keep in mind that you can only watch 720p youtube videos only. camera quality is not that great. remember, it has got only 2gb ram, when running on oreio and pie 3gb is mandatory. so, you can notice moderate lag. battery life is not up to the mark. it is only 3000mah battery. can stand for one day if used moderately. takes lot of time to get fully charged. the charger capacity is only 5volt and 1amps. speaker volume is low and when you are on call it is moderately loud. signal quality is good. if you are really tight on budget, please accumulate few more bucks and go for other options in the same price range other than this. this is purely ment for amateurs. do not expect to play pubg at full graphics with this phone.

the redmi 6a is the cheapest phone the company sells and is one of the cheapest smartphones you can buy today. while looking at the spec sheet it is easy to feel like you are getting a great deal for the price, in reality, that may not be the case. in case of the redmi 6a, the phone is very affordable but xiaomi has cut corner in key areas such as chipset and memory, which results in rather poor everyday performance. the phone just feels ponderous to use and that is today. a year or two down the line it will likely be insufferable. that is a shame because some of the other aspects of the phone, such as the design, the display, and even the camera are actually pretty good. had it been armed with a faster chipset, this would have been a good entry-level smartphone.

this is my first high value purchase from amazon and after reading so many negative reviews regarding product quality or delivery issues i am really surprised or may be i am really lucky. my phone arrived in one piece and very well packaged in a tamper proof packaging. only issue was the delivery man who was a little rude. about the phone; i am supper happy having the phone in my hand. it is sleek design, fits in the palm perfectly for single hand operation. there are features, like face unlock and full screen mode which is really next level. others may have experienced it in higher end phone but for me it was first. in the normal mode you can use "home" and "back" buttons, which is part of the display, (there are no separate buttons on the phone at the bottom, complete clean design). but in the full screen mode, the buttons disappear and give you full "full screen" experience. "home" and "back" actions are controlled through gestures which is wonderful for people like me who like to be nerdy and sophisticated. people who do not know, will keep scratching their heads, how to go back or go to home screen and think that the software is corrupted. but it gives extra layer of security to me. the face unlock simply unlocks your phone without indicating their is face unlock on the phone. there is "second space" which you can use to hide your important app data and files and chats etc. it unlocks with a separate pin created for the same. so use normal login for public profile and hidden login for private profile. just use different pins for different logins. navigation is smooth (even in full screen mode, which i am using normally and not the button mode). just swipe to go to home screen or go back or switch between apps. it is mi phone so build quality is good. i am a person who likes to tweak his phone from inside out so looking forward to discover hidden features and make the best of this phone. also, it has automatic brightness control mode which is default so while you setup your phone, the screen brightness may change to dim to medium. you can choose to set this to off after phone is setup. i hope you too enjoy your new redmi 6a, i am just super excited. :) i am giving 4 stars because i rarely give 5 stars. so 4 stars means one of the best. i give 5 stars only when i feel service has been over over delivered. although it is a very good product, and most importantly made in india i still think there is room for additions and improvement.

pros: 1) decent video/audio recording with minimum distortion. (noise cancellation is much much better than redmi 5a) 2) decent camera for a budget phone. 3) good for android smartphone beginners. 4) can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. 5) fast boot. 6) good touch response for a budget phone, i find it to extra sensitive. haha cons: 1) bad video quality for watching movies/ you tube. but i use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes instagram. i use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me. 2) unable to share internet hotspot to computer/laptop. but i posted a tip on how to solve this problem in mi community india. all you need to do is download an app called pdanet+ (available in google play store) in both your phone and computer. go and check it out. apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. if you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. the 1440x720 resolution is much worse compared to redmi 5a's 1280x720. in fact redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to redmi 6a. ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.

to say in short, its one of the best devices out there in it is price bracket. i have got three of them for my family, different colours, configs etc. its a budget device and we must expect similar performance from it. but still a good to go for a casual user. ••••••••••••••• inside box ••••••••••••••• 1. device 2. usb cable 3. charger 4. sim ejector tool 5. few guides (no earphones, as is with every budget & midrange device) ••••••••••••••••••• about device ••••••••••••••••••• as for trend goes, mi phones are value for money always. this one's no exception. ▶ screen 9/10 ▶ camera 8/10 (samples included) ▶ battery 9/10 (1 day 23 hour 14 min on battery, 100% to 4%; 6hrs 50min sot) ▶ performance 7/10 ▶ build 8/10 ▶ sound 8/10 overall 8.1/10 •••••••• pros •••••••• 1. low price bracket i.e. budget friendly. 2. refreshing looks with rounded corner display & body. 3. light, slim phone with good build quality. 4. reasonable features & performance. 5. nice 5.45 in hd display (1440 x 720 pixels resolution), 295 ppi and 18:9 aspect ratio. good sunlight legibility. 6. full screen gestures which removes on screen buttons for back, recents, home and increases screen area. 7. no hybrid slot. instead three separate slots, so 2 sim and extra memory at same time. 8. dual 4g standby (enable it in settings - sim cards & mobile network). 9. android oreo 8.1/miui 10.2.1 out of box. periodic security & bug fixing updates are provided. 10. plethora of sensors (except ir in specific). 11. pretty decent camera (samples attached) 12. 32gb internal is quite sufficient 13. face unlock works good. low light unlocking may not work properly. •••••••• cons •••••••• 1. performance may be a issue as its budget device with mediocre hardware. but what to expect from extremely low budget device. 3. helio vs qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device. 4. too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them & techies will be able to remove stubborn ones too via adb. 2. no ir blaster in 6a, i do use it a lot. it is one the key features for me. 5. no fingerprint reader •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• battery backup (screenshots attached) •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• device status: locked bootloader, max apps restricted for notification access & autostart, screen brightness medium, and location off. sim 1, 2g mode (50% 3g, only during data usage) sim 2, 2g mode wifi on (60%, data on standby) data on (40%, wifi on standby) night time: data & wifi off ▶ 1 day 23 hr 14 min on battery, 100% to 4% (awesome, right?) ▶ sot (screen on time) 6hrs 50min (impressive) ••••••••••••••••••• final verdict ••••••••••••••••••• ▶ having already purchased 3 of redmi 6a series device, i would suggest you to go for it if in tight budget and you cant shell out extra. you get a new device with current day trend of screen & camera, ai and looks, all with ok performace. just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go. p.s. its not at all meant for gaming. though cassual games will be ok. ▶ already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. current apps n content consume a lot of space. ▶ even after launch of redmi 7 series, 6a is still in shelves for a reason. it offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. none of the current devices can beat its price point. available frequently on sale for 500 less. ▶ but be open to other options available out there, you may shell out few bucks extra to avoid cons.

it is such an amazing budget phone. mi rocks. the display is so good. sound is awesome. camera works decent. it has face recognition which works well. its design is amazing and the weight is so light. there was no lag in the phone. it works perfectly well for normal applications. video quality is amazing. 4g works well. 5.45inch screen is big enough it is cool. I am sure there are still lots of features in this 6k phone! grab it before the introductory offer is gone, else you will end up paying 7k for same phone.

i had recently purchased mi 6a phone. but after 3 days of the purchase the phone started giving issues on the call quality. while the call is going on suddenly there is a drop of the voice where either side cannot hear each other. i did not expect this with mi phones as previous versions have been quite stable. this is unfortunate that the date of return is gone and now only the repair center will be doing the rest by taking another 15 days to fix the same.

my core requirements was a smart phone with a whatsapp in it, so i can always keep in touch with my parents without them much hesitating about how critical to use a new phone is. this certainly meets all the basic conventional requirements for the modern day era. secondly the battery back up is quite decent with a 100 percent charge u can always browse and play with this phone for almost the entire day. in hibernation mode it should be atleast a 50percent more i.e 1.5 days without charging in between. now, all u need is an internal memory card micro sd of atleast 64 gb because the inbuilt storage is quite less and would not suffice the load of data storage from hefty whatsapp groups let alone your music and photos. the face recognition works well however there is a 2sec lag which should not be a very big deal provided the price tag of it. with a 2 gb ram the phone does not seem to be hanging till now, so all in all a cool phone.

i think this is one of the best package in this price segment. everything is fulfill your satisfaction. - battery life is very impressive. - phone feels premium in the hand specially it is very light weight. - speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume but it is ok. - design part i love it very much - picture quality not highly impressive it is average quality they given 13 mp rear camera | 5 mp front camera. - processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it is rarely noticeable. - phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection otherwise if the phone fall from your hand then your phone maybe damaged. - for long time use this phone is hanging, it run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. - video quality is not good for watching movies/ you tube. overall i like this.

ordered the phone in the amazon sale and eager to put a review on website. here's a detailed review with pros cons and ratings. pros: + good build + nice display + powerful chipset + lag free performance + no heating + 2 day battery + good front and rear cameras + quick charge 3.0 supported + case provided in the box + 3 separate sd slots ( 1 for micro sd card + 2 for sim card ) cons: - screen size bit small - no type-c port ratings: design: 8/10 display: 8/10 battery: 10/10 back camera: 9/10 front camera: 8/10 processor: 9/10 call quality: 9/10 sound from speakers: 9/10 sound from earphones: 8/10 pricing: 10/10 overall rating: 9/10 detailed review: here's what you get inside the box: 1. handset 2. charger 3. usb charging cable 4. sim ejector pin design: the design of redmi 6a is slim and small, easy to hold it . the build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. rating 8/10. display: the display on the front is a full hd 5.45-inch notch display with 18:9 aspect ratio. the display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. it is covered with a 2.5d glass which gives it a premium look. the notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. i think xiaomi could have done a bit better here. small notches mean less space for notification icons so that is not great. rating 8/10. battery: the phone comes with a 3000 mah . so, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. one nice improvement in redmi 6a is that quick charge 3.0 is available now. the phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. rating 10/10. audio: the speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. the audio via the earphone is average if you do not tweak the settings. so, I had recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. rating 8.5/10. performance: the redmi 6 a runs on android v8.1 operating system with 2.0ghz mediatek helio a22 quad core processor is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. app opens and close fast. not good for gaming as screen is small. if you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 32 bg variant. rating 8.5/10. security: face unlock work well on the redmi 6 a. no fingerprint sensor. face unlock takes a bit of time (less than 2 second) to unlock the device. face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so do not use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. rating 9/10. pricing: the pricing of redmi 6 a was a bit of a surprise because it was available for rs 5999 + additional instant discount during the amazon sale of rs 600. rating: 10/10. camera: with 13 mp rear and 5 mp front camera. the aperture and pixel size ( 1440 * 720 pixels and 295 ppi pixel density ) has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. in earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations. the front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. the performance of front camera is good as well. pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. the dynamic range was not great though. rating 8.5/10. summary overall, redmi 6 a pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 5999, we think it offers good value for money. if you have a budget of around 7000 - 8000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then redmi 6 a should be your choice. if you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then you ought to raise your budget and go for a higher specification models. which color is the best? if you like to keep things simple, then go for the black color. if you need something bright and flashy then go for the blue color which looks really nice. i hope you liked the review. if it was helpful, please give thumbs-up/upvote.

you must read the review and decide yourself whether to purchase this fragile phone or not, because there no returns on this purchase! in order to make it available at cheapest possible price xiomi has cut corners on several fronts. read on! 1. sound quality is absolutely not upto the mark! 2. plastic body is so thin phone has become fragile! 3. volume rocker buttons are not going to last for many months, they are thin and weak. 4. no gorilla glass screen, it looks unimpressive. 5. overall it is totally disappointing to hold the redmi 6a. 6. camera megapixles-wise ok, but havent tested the performance. 7. miui 10 great,but with smaller screen not fun to operate it. 8. surprisingly 2 gb ram is inadequate for faster response of opening apps or unlocking the screen. 9. phone is extremely prone to usual use screen damage and wear and tear, also not strong enough to withstand daily use. 10. god forbid, if you drop the phone its 'the end' foe the phone! it will not just damage the screen but the entire assembly (motherboard etc.) i would never recommend this phone despite its specifications because it s not strong enough!

the hardware is awesome, with good display, camera and all... but the miui is a real trap. reasons listed below. 1. privacy: they have launched alternate apps for every google apps. they are constantly collecting user data. be it via keyboard, their videoplayer, browser, cloud backup- anything. the only thing i wanted from redmi is hardware. but a lot of rubbish spying softwares also came along with it, branded as miui. the worst part is we cannot even disable most of these, thus taking extra ram space. 2. space: the miui and all the spying apps that comes along with these needs constant updates. and we cannot disabl the updates. soon all these heavy updates are going to take ur space- both ram and internal storage. and this is a dirty business tactics used by them to life their customers into buying a high-end phone the next time. overall review: hardware and config- above edpectation. software- sucks. conclusion: dont buy this. it is a trap. buy other phones in this segnent without any inbuilt apps.

redmi 6a will be the best pick in the budget range. other competitors cannot give the features and quality which redmi can give you at your hand and in a cheapest range. the best features of this phone is, its traditional looks and features. battery life is also long lasting. so no doubt, you can go for it. i just have one issue with the packaging of the product by amazon. they have sent a plactic packet, i was shocked! but no damage or physical harm have occured. i am happy with my new device! thanks redmi, for giving us an oppurtunity to ascend to a new smartphone in an affordable price range. thank you.

it is been a month i am using this device in free time and i must say it is a smartphone with descent specs and good battery backup. here are few pros and cons according to my experience: pros: 1) price- just ₹5999 bucks ! 2) battery- it last about 1.5 day in light usage but less than a day in heavy usage. 3) camera with eis! - that is insane to have image stabilization on board at this price. camera is descent and capture good photos but noise levels are high under low light conditions but hdr helps a bit to eliminate them 4) looks & design- it is a personal opinion- this phone is comfortable to hold and looks great too! 5) performance- it is good for light usage and low end games. cons: 1) battery- 3000mah is good but 4000mah should do great justice. 2) miui - full of adds and bloatware. 3) not so smooth! - i encounter light to little lag while using this device. also comes with meditek helio a22 chipset which sounds fancy but average in performance. 4) memory management- miui is heavy and leave around 800_900 mb of free ram out of 2gb! conclusion: i would recommend this device for those who are ok with the above cons or else go for realme c2 to be launched within couple of days. p.s. i gifted this phone to my mum 😅

redmi has not worked on their camera for low light, hence picture quality at night stays poor. but picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price, the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well. it lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once. but i usually can play games seamlessly. the sound outlet is at the back. that is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed, it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones. sound is okay, not very loud. just fine and doable. battery life could have been better, but if you are not online all day or playing video games for hours, changing once a day is more than enough. biggest problem I have faced is that the hotspot of this phone does not always work on my laptop. my laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots. all over, it is a good looking phone with sufficient qualities for this price point.

1. the sound is too low that you will not hear the ring tone. the problem mostly occurs if you keep phone down (on table or some where similar). my mom has been using the phone for past couple of days and she has not been taking any phone calls since then. no one in the house is even hearing the sound to pick when ringing. 2. 5a was much better than 6a in terms of screen size. even though the dimensions of 6a is bigger, 5a has much better usability. ( eg : the back button which is placed in 5a vs 6a ) . 3. the photos / videos app is too noisy that it confuse what we should do with it. 4. too much of tracking / spam apps to advertise. 5. the apps are getting hanging. you want to close the opened apps. the ui is a mess. 6. no infrared feature as in 5a. oh god, your data is taken to china in the name of make in india. i wonder why the government is allowing such things.

xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets. i am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but xiaomi is not good these days. mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4a can easily beat it. though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing. battery life is no way close to the redmi 4a or 5a. and the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst . worst xiaomi phone ever. now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful realme c1 , feature rich lenovo a5 and snappy asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.even redmi 5a is far better choice than this. wish things get improved with miui updates.

i bought this phone few days back and frankly speaking, i could not refrain from sharing my reviews. at first, thank you amazon for such a wonderful product and best offer to ever loving customers with discount from various banks. my basic need was a phone that can support 2 jio sim's at once. for my un-fortunate belief, every website shown phone which were costing not less than 10k. redmi 6a, redmi rocks again !!! once again, one of the best product from redmi for optimal price with excellent features. pros: support 2 jio sims at once. dual sim jio lovers certainly cant miss this phone. slim, light weight and enough handy. performance and speed wise, its a good call camera, sound and seemless transition is good security options plenty. voice quality is good cons : average battery. no finger print. overall, it served my need of 2 jio sims for which, i am so happy about this product. thank you redmi... keep rocking !!!

i was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother. i had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused 😕 finally i placed the order and bought it through amazon. believe me it fabulous product so far. the screen is apt and very clear. battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc. memory is 32 gb so lot of space for apps and other material. infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 gb memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space. phone is quite light weight and very smart. i chose blue color and believe me it looks classy. only issue it does not come with earphones🤔🤔🤔 i respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but i recommend this to all buyers. in nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too. cheers 👍💕

phone is pretty bad, thought it would be good considering so many positive reviews. cons hangs a lot, it hangs so frequently that it feels like it is a 1-2year old phone within 60days of use. mi forces you to use it is app which i do not trust, but it keeps forcing me to switch my current app to mi apps, like browser/image gallery/message etc

honestly speaking, this was my first xiaomi device that i bought from amazon. and I am not disappointed at all. the battery life is good, the screen quality is good and the sound quality is good as well. the only problem is that the speaker is backfacing, so if the phone is kept with screen upwards, then any sound, specially call ringtone, will not be heard at all. even at the highest volume. the phone is good at this price. decent performance. the camera is good as well. for a person who is looking for a first smartphone, go for it. but beware of bloatware. it might annoy you. thank you.

i bought this phone for my mom but i thought i should test it as my primary device for few days. after few days of usage here are first impressions of this budget phone: ● build quality (8/10): it has a solid plastic build. it has rear curves slightly towards the edges which gives good grip on phone so do not worry about slipping phone from your hand. ● camera (9/10): 13 mp rear camera takes decent shots in daylight. the front camera is 5 mp with portrait mode feature which works on ai which does fairly good job. so selfie camera in general takes decent photos with beauty mode. ● display(8.5/10) : it has 5.4 inches hd lcd display with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes less bezels. viewing angles are not that good but acceptable for two peoples. it performs average in sunlight keeping in mind its price. ● performance(7/10): this phone comes with helio a22 chipset with 2 gb ram. phone comes with so many pre loaded apps which you can disable. this phone sucks in multitasking. you can play small games on it. xiaomi will improve it is performance with miui 10 update.(miui 10 beta is already out and works fantastic) ● battery(9/10): it has decent 3000 mah battery which gives you whole day power for moderate usage. other specifications which are impressive at this price: 1. ai face unlock 2. dual volte 3. dual sim slot + memory card slot cons: no fingerprint scanner overall rating : 8.5/10 with such a low price tag it is best mobile in the market. you can definitely buy it. recommended.

the cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. i fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. portrait mode does not work properly either. i do not expect the camera of s8 or iphone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. other features work well but i was really let down with the camera this time.

it is a very good choice on a small budget. i tell you why... screen - ips screen with hd+ (720*1440) display , it looks very nice easy to read in day light. note - mobile screen has round shape (but screen shot has corners , idk how) battery - i have submitted screen shots about battery uses (it is without sim card) it took 19 hours, from 100 percent to 81 percent (with screen on 33 minutes and with no sim card) so in my opinion battery is decent enough for a day use camera - i have submitted the photo sample . you can check in ti photos . these photos are taken in day light camera is good for day light shooting. sound sound quality is good, in speaker as well as in earphone (earphone is not provided with handset) phone speaker is loud enough to fill a room os and ui comes with android version 8.1 😊 ui is great , easy to understand. it comes with some unnecessary pre-loaded apps which can be deleted (but not the mi apps) network calling i have used it in whatsapp calling only and the voice clarity was good, no issue. i will update my review after 1-2 weeks of use . recommended ? yes, best smart phone according to the budget.

well to be honest m disappointed with mi this time and m shocked actually. i have used mi devices a lot. redmi note 3, note 5, and so on and currently have mi max 2 as well but this tiny phone redmi 6a is a big let down. reasons below 1.the advanced beauty selfie mode with so called ai sucks until its bright sunlight daylight outside so the selfie lovers this is ain't a phone or a camera for selfish lovers in low light cabs pub bars etc for selfie lovers. 2.heating issue while charging is annoying. especially with power bank in traveling in hand or pocket or even bike or car. 3.the unlocking screen thing is not smooth i have to swipe up multiple times not sure why or if its a problem with my cheap screen guard tempered glass unless the same dowrks fine with ny other devices 4.inky good thing is the speaker output and the sound. just brilliant. awsome 5.tiny style with good grip slim look and as a secondary phone or a phone for standard smartphone users and aslo for people with a little high age like people above 50s will be a great phone. 6.battery backup is fine for a day with 4g and wifi fibuse at home. 7.thenese and scustomizations level as usual awesome. 8/neteork is fine and called voice quality is good too. 9.balcony color is good just that the finger print sensor would have made much more sense. 10.most importantly extra memory card slot saves you and also that 2 gb ram is not adequate.

brought this mobile for my mom. manily purchased it keeping budget in mind and my mom's a ability to handle a smart phone. not regreting too much since the user is amateur. but, if you are an advanced user or a gamer kindly avoid this phone. there are few more options available if you can able to add few more thousands to your budget. build quality is okay display is okay, not that great. keep in mind that you can only watch 720p youtube videos only. camera quality is not that great. remember, it has got only 2gb ram, when running on oreio and pie 3gb is mandatory. so, you can notice moderate lag. battery life is not up to the mark. it is only 3000mah battery. can stand for one day if used moderately. takes lot of time to get fully charged. the charger capacity is only 5volt and 1amps. speaker volume is low and when you are on call it is moderately loud. signal quality is good. if you are really tight on budget, please accumulate few more bucks and go for other options in the same price range other than this. this is purely ment for amateurs. do not expect to play pubg at full graphics with this phone.

the redmi 6a is the cheapest phone the company sells and is one of the cheapest smartphones you can buy today. while looking at the spec sheet it is easy to feel like you are getting a great deal for the price, in reality, that may not be the case. in case of the redmi 6a, the phone is very affordable but xiaomi has cut corner in key areas such as chipset and memory, which results in rather poor everyday performance. the phone just feels ponderous to use and that is today. a year or two down the line it will likely be insufferable. that is a shame because some of the other aspects of the phone, such as the design, the display, and even the camera are actually pretty good. had it been armed with a faster chipset, this would have been a good entry-level smartphone.

this redmi 6a is a pretty much budget smart phone. but comparing the price, nobody should complain about the product. the phone is pretty much for regular users, who use their phones to call, do social networking, take occasional pictures and selfies. the processor is fine, but ram is limited when compared to android oreo (8.0). the phone is sleek and has extremely good finish. the phone looks very goo. one can defnitely go for it, if budget is the factor. if you can increase the budget by 1k-2k, then samsung m10 is much better choice though. pros ----- 1. very good looking 2. comes with anrdoid oreo 3. very sleek 4. dual 4g sim, separate memory slot 5. octa core processor 6. 2gb ram 7. 3000 mah battery cons ----- 1. average camera, but not poor final verdict: good phone for limited budget

this is my first high value purchase from amazon and after reading so many negative reviews regarding product quality or delivery issues i am really surprised or may be i am really lucky. my phone arrived in one piece and very well packaged in a tamper proof packaging. only issue was the delivery man who was a little rude. about the phone; i am supper happy having the phone in my hand. it is sleek design, fits in the palm perfectly for single hand operation. there are features, like face unlock and full screen mode which is really next level. others may have experienced it in higher end phone but for me it was first. in the normal mode you can use "home" and "back" buttons, which is part of the display, (there are no separate buttons on the phone at the bottom, complete clean design). but in the full screen mode, the buttons disappear and give you full "full screen" experience. "home" and "back" actions are controlled through gestures which is wonderful for people like me who like to be nerdy and sophisticated. people who do not know, will keep scratching their heads, how to go back or go to home screen and think that the software is corrupted. but it gives extra layer of security to me. the face unlock simply unlocks your phone without indicating their is face unlock on the phone. there is "second space" which you can use to hide your important app data and files and chats etc. it unlocks with a separate pin created for the same. so use normal login for public profile and hidden login for private profile. just use different pins for different logins. navigation is smooth (even in full screen mode, which i am using normally and not the button mode). just swipe to go to home screen or go back or switch between apps. it is mi phone so build quality is good. i am a person who likes to tweak his phone from inside out so looking forward to discover hidden features and make the best of this phone. also, it has automatic brightness control mode which is default so while you setup your phone, the screen brightness may change to dim to medium. you can choose to set this to off after phone is setup. i hope you too enjoy your new redmi 6a, i am just super excited. :) i am giving 4 stars because i rarely give 5 stars. so 4 stars means one of the best. i give 5 stars only when i feel service has been over over delivered. although it is a very good product, and most importantly made in india i still think there is room for additions and improvement.

pros: 1) decent video/audio recording with minimum distortion. (noise cancellation is much much better than redmi 5a) 2) decent camera for a budget phone. 3) good for android smartphone beginners. 4) can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. 5) fast boot. 6) good touch response for a budget phone, i find it to extra sensitive. haha cons: 1) bad video quality for watching movies/ you tube. but i use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes instagram. i use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me. 2) unable to share internet hotspot to computer/laptop. but i posted a tip on how to solve this problem in mi community india. all you need to do is download an app called pdanet+ (available in google play store) in both your phone and computer. go and check it out. apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. if you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. the 1440x720 resolution is much worse compared to redmi 5a's 1280x720. in fact redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to redmi 6a. ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.

to say in short, its one of the best devices out there in it is price bracket. i have got three of them for my family, different colours, configs etc. its a budget device and we must expect similar performance from it. but still a good to go for a casual user. ••••••••••••••• inside box ••••••••••••••• 1. device 2. usb cable 3. charger 4. sim ejector tool 5. few guides (no earphones, as is with every budget & midrange device) ••••••••••••••••••• about device ••••••••••••••••••• as for trend goes, mi phones are value for money always. this one's no exception. ▶ screen 9/10 ▶ camera 8/10 (samples included) ▶ battery 9/10 (1 day 23 hour 14 min on battery, 100% to 4%; 6hrs 50min sot) ▶ performance 7/10 ▶ build 8/10 ▶ sound 8/10 overall 8.1/10 •••••••• pros •••••••• 1. low price bracket i.e. budget friendly. 2. refreshing looks with rounded corner display & body. 3. light, slim phone with good build quality. 4. reasonable features & performance. 5. nice 5.45 in hd display (1440 x 720 pixels resolution), 295 ppi and 18:9 aspect ratio. good sunlight legibility. 6. full screen gestures which removes on screen buttons for back, recents, home and increases screen area. 7. no hybrid slot. instead three separate slots, so 2 sim and extra memory at same time. 8. dual 4g standby (enable it in settings - sim cards & mobile network). 9. android oreo 8.1/miui 10.2.1 out of box. periodic security & bug fixing updates are provided. 10. plethora of sensors (except ir in specific). 11. pretty decent camera (samples attached) 12. 32gb internal is quite sufficient 13. face unlock works good. low light unlocking may not work properly. •••••••• cons •••••••• 1. performance may be a issue as its budget device with mediocre hardware. but what to expect from extremely low budget device. 3. helio vs qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device. 4. too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them & techies will be able to remove stubborn ones too via adb. 2. no ir blaster in 6a, i do use it a lot. it is one the key features for me. 5. no fingerprint reader •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• battery backup (screenshots attached) •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• device status: locked bootloader, max apps restricted for notification access & autostart, screen brightness medium, and location off. sim 1, 2g mode (50% 3g, only during data usage) sim 2, 2g mode wifi on (60%, data on standby) data on (40%, wifi on standby) night time: data & wifi off ▶ 1 day 23 hr 14 min on battery, 100% to 4% (awesome, right?) ▶ sot (screen on time) 6hrs 50min (impressive) ••••••••••••••••••• final verdict ••••••••••••••••••• ▶ having already purchased 3 of redmi 6a series device, i would suggest you to go for it if in tight budget and you cant shell out extra. you get a new device with current day trend of screen & camera, ai and looks, all with ok performace. just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go. p.s. its not at all meant for gaming. though cassual games will be ok. ▶ already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. current apps n content consume a lot of space. ▶ even after launch of redmi 7 series, 6a is still in shelves for a reason. it offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. none of the current devices can beat its price point. available frequently on sale for 500 less. ▶ but be open to other options available out there, you may shell out few bucks extra to avoid cons.

it is such an amazing budget phone. mi rocks. the display is so good. sound is awesome. camera works decent. it has face recognition which works well. its design is amazing and the weight is so light. there was no lag in the phone. it works perfectly well for normal applications. video quality is amazing. 4g works well. 5.45inch screen is big enough it is cool. I am sure there are still lots of features in this 6k phone! grab it before the introductory offer is gone, else you will end up paying 7k for same phone.

i had recently purchased mi 6a phone. but after 3 days of the purchase the phone started giving issues on the call quality. while the call is going on suddenly there is a drop of the voice where either side cannot hear each other. i did not expect this with mi phones as previous versions have been quite stable. this is unfortunate that the date of return is gone and now only the repair center will be doing the rest by taking another 15 days to fix the same.

my core requirements was a smart phone with a whatsapp in it, so i can always keep in touch with my parents without them much hesitating about how critical to use a new phone is. this certainly meets all the basic conventional requirements for the modern day era. secondly the battery back up is quite decent with a 100 percent charge u can always browse and play with this phone for almost the entire day. in hibernation mode it should be atleast a 50percent more i.e 1.5 days without charging in between. now, all u need is an internal memory card micro sd of atleast 64 gb because the inbuilt storage is quite less and would not suffice the load of data storage from hefty whatsapp groups let alone your music and photos. the face recognition works well however there is a 2sec lag which should not be a very big deal provided the price tag of it. with a 2 gb ram the phone does not seem to be hanging till now, so all in all a cool phone.

i think this is one of the best package in this price segment. everything is fulfill your satisfaction. - battery life is very impressive. - phone feels premium in the hand specially it is very light weight. - speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume but it is ok. - design part i love it very much - picture quality not highly impressive it is average quality they given 13 mp rear camera | 5 mp front camera. - processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it is rarely noticeable. - phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection otherwise if the phone fall from your hand then your phone maybe damaged. - for long time use this phone is hanging, it run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. - video quality is not good for watching movies/ you tube. overall i like this.

ordered the phone in the amazon sale and eager to put a review on website. here's a detailed review with pros cons and ratings. pros: + good build + nice display + powerful chipset + lag free performance + no heating + 2 day battery + good front and rear cameras + quick charge 3.0 supported + case provided in the box + 3 separate sd slots ( 1 for micro sd card + 2 for sim card ) cons: - screen size bit small - no type-c port ratings: design: 8/10 display: 8/10 battery: 10/10 back camera: 9/10 front camera: 8/10 processor: 9/10 call quality: 9/10 sound from speakers: 9/10 sound from earphones: 8/10 pricing: 10/10 overall rating: 9/10 detailed review: here's what you get inside the box: 1. handset 2. charger 3. usb charging cable 4. sim ejector pin design: the design of redmi 6a is slim and small, easy to hold it . the build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. rating 8/10. display: the display on the front is a full hd 5.45-inch notch display with 18:9 aspect ratio. the display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. it is covered with a 2.5d glass which gives it a premium look. the notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. i think xiaomi could have done a bit better here. small notches mean less space for notification icons so that is not great. rating 8/10. battery: the phone comes with a 3000 mah . so, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. one nice improvement in redmi 6a is that quick charge 3.0 is available now. the phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. rating 10/10. audio: the speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. the audio via the earphone is average if you do not tweak the settings. so, I had recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. rating 8.5/10. performance: the redmi 6 a runs on android v8.1 operating system with 2.0ghz mediatek helio a22 quad core processor is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. app opens and close fast. not good for gaming as screen is small. if you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 32 bg variant. rating 8.5/10. security: face unlock work well on the redmi 6 a. no fingerprint sensor. face unlock takes a bit of time (less than 2 second) to unlock the device. face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so do not use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. rating 9/10. pricing: the pricing of redmi 6 a was a bit of a surprise because it was available for rs 5999 + additional instant discount during the amazon sale of rs 600. rating: 10/10. camera: with 13 mp rear and 5 mp front camera. the aperture and pixel size ( 1440 * 720 pixels and 295 ppi pixel density ) has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. in earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations. the front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. the performance of front camera is good as well. pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. the dynamic range was not great though. rating 8.5/10. summary overall, redmi 6 a pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 5999, we think it offers good value for money. if you have a budget of around 7000 - 8000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then redmi 6 a should be your choice. if you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then you ought to raise your budget and go for a higher specification models. which color is the best? if you like to keep things simple, then go for the black color. if you need something bright and flashy then go for the blue color which looks really nice. i hope you liked the review. if it was helpful, please give thumbs-up/upvote.

you must read the review and decide yourself whether to purchase this fragile phone or not, because there no returns on this purchase! in order to make it available at cheapest possible price xiomi has cut corners on several fronts. read on! 1. sound quality is absolutely not upto the mark! 2. plastic body is so thin phone has become fragile! 3. volume rocker buttons are not going to last for many months, they are thin and weak. 4. no gorilla glass screen, it looks unimpressive. 5. overall it is totally disappointing to hold the redmi 6a. 6. camera megapixles-wise ok, but havent tested the performance. 7. miui 10 great,but with smaller screen not fun to operate it. 8. surprisingly 2 gb ram is inadequate for faster response of opening apps or unlocking the screen. 9. phone is extremely prone to usual use screen damage and wear and tear, also not strong enough to withstand daily use. 10. god forbid, if you drop the phone its 'the end' foe the phone! it will not just damage the screen but the entire assembly (motherboard etc.) i would never recommend this phone despite its specifications because it s not strong enough!

the hardware is awesome, with good display, camera and all... but the miui is a real trap. reasons listed below. 1. privacy: they have launched alternate apps for every google apps. they are constantly collecting user data. be it via keyboard, their videoplayer, browser, cloud backup- anything. the only thing i wanted from redmi is hardware. but a lot of rubbish spying softwares also came along with it, branded as miui. the worst part is we cannot even disable most of these, thus taking extra ram space. 2. space: the miui and all the spying apps that comes along with these needs constant updates. and we cannot disabl the updates. soon all these heavy updates are going to take ur space- both ram and internal storage. and this is a dirty business tactics used by them to life their customers into buying a high-end phone the next time. overall review: hardware and config- above edpectation. software- sucks. conclusion: dont buy this. it is a trap. buy other phones in this segnent without any inbuilt apps.

redmi 6a will be the best pick in the budget range. other competitors cannot give the features and quality which redmi can give you at your hand and in a cheapest range. the best features of this phone is, its traditional looks and features. battery life is also long lasting. so no doubt, you can go for it. i just have one issue with the packaging of the product by amazon. they have sent a plactic packet, i was shocked! but no damage or physical harm have occured. i am happy with my new device! thanks redmi, for giving us an oppurtunity to ascend to a new smartphone in an affordable price range. thank you.

it is been a month i am using this device in free time and i must say it is a smartphone with descent specs and good battery backup. here are few pros and cons according to my experience: pros: 1) price- just ₹5999 bucks ! 2) battery- it last about 1.5 day in light usage but less than a day in heavy usage. 3) camera with eis! - that is insane to have image stabilization on board at this price. camera is descent and capture good photos but noise levels are high under low light conditions but hdr helps a bit to eliminate them 4) looks & design- it is a personal opinion- this phone is comfortable to hold and looks great too! 5) performance- it is good for light usage and low end games. cons: 1) battery- 3000mah is good but 4000mah should do great justice. 2) miui - full of adds and bloatware. 3) not so smooth! - i encounter light to little lag while using this device. also comes with meditek helio a22 chipset which sounds fancy but average in performance. 4) memory management- miui is heavy and leave around 800_900 mb of free ram out of 2gb! conclusion: i would recommend this device for those who are ok with the above cons or else go for realme c2 to be launched within couple of days. p.s. i gifted this phone to my mum 😅

redmi has not worked on their camera for low light, hence picture quality at night stays poor. but picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price, the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well. it lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once. but i usually can play games seamlessly. the sound outlet is at the back. that is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed, it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones. sound is okay, not very loud. just fine and doable. battery life could have been better, but if you are not online all day or playing video games for hours, changing once a day is more than enough. biggest problem I have faced is that the hotspot of this phone does not always work on my laptop. my laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots. all over, it is a good looking phone with sufficient qualities for this price point.

1. the sound is too low that you will not hear the ring tone. the problem mostly occurs if you keep phone down (on table or some where similar). my mom has been using the phone for past couple of days and she has not been taking any phone calls since then. no one in the house is even hearing the sound to pick when ringing. 2. 5a was much better than 6a in terms of screen size. even though the dimensions of 6a is bigger, 5a has much better usability. ( eg : the back button which is placed in 5a vs 6a ) . 3. the photos / videos app is too noisy that it confuse what we should do with it. 4. too much of tracking / spam apps to advertise. 5. the apps are getting hanging. you want to close the opened apps. the ui is a mess. 6. no infrared feature as in 5a. oh god, your data is taken to china in the name of make in india. i wonder why the government is allowing such things.

xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets. i am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but xiaomi is not good these days. mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4a can easily beat it. though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing. battery life is no way close to the redmi 4a or 5a. and the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst . worst xiaomi phone ever. now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful realme c1 , feature rich lenovo a5 and snappy asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.even redmi 5a is far better choice than this. wish things get improved with miui updates.

i bought this phone few days back and frankly speaking, i could not refrain from sharing my reviews. at first, thank you amazon for such a wonderful product and best offer to ever loving customers with discount from various banks. my basic need was a phone that can support 2 jio sim's at once. for my un-fortunate belief, every website shown phone which were costing not less than 10k. redmi 6a, redmi rocks again !!! once again, one of the best product from redmi for optimal price with excellent features. pros: support 2 jio sims at once. dual sim jio lovers certainly cant miss this phone. slim, light weight and enough handy. performance and speed wise, its a good call camera, sound and seemless transition is good security options plenty. voice quality is good cons : average battery. no finger print. overall, it served my need of 2 jio sims for which, i am so happy about this product. thank you redmi... keep rocking !!!

i was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother. i had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused 😕 finally i placed the order and bought it through amazon. believe me it fabulous product so far. the screen is apt and very clear. battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc. memory is 32 gb so lot of space for apps and other material. infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 gb memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space. phone is quite light weight and very smart. i chose blue color and believe me it looks classy. only issue it does not come with earphones🤔🤔🤔 i respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but i recommend this to all buyers. in nutshell its not only value for money but gud choice too. cheers 👍💕

phone is pretty bad, thought it would be good considering so many positive reviews. cons hangs a lot, it hangs so frequently that it feels like it is a 1-2year old phone within 60days of use. mi forces you to use it is app which i do not trust, but it keeps forcing me to switch my current app to mi apps, like browser/image gallery/message etc

honestly speaking, this was my first xiaomi device that i bought from amazon. and I am not disappointed at all. the battery life is good, the screen quality is good and the sound quality is good as well. the only problem is that the speaker is backfacing, so if the phone is kept with screen upwards, then any sound, specially call ringtone, will not be heard at all. even at the highest volume. the phone is good at this price. decent performance. the camera is good as well. for a person who is looking for a first smartphone, go for it. but beware of bloatware. it might annoy you. thank you.

i bought this phone for my mom but i thought i should test it as my primary device for few days. after few days of usage here are first impressions of this budget phone: ● build quality (8/10): it has a solid plastic build. it has rear curves slightly towards the edges which gives good grip on phone so do not worry about slipping phone from your hand. ● camera (9/10): 13 mp rear camera takes decent shots in daylight. the front camera is 5 mp with portrait mode feature which works on ai which does fairly good job. so selfie camera in general takes decent photos with beauty mode. ● display(8.5/10) : it has 5.4 inches hd lcd display with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes less bezels. viewing angles are not that good but acceptable for two peoples. it performs average in sunlight keeping in mind its price. ● performance(7/10): this phone comes with helio a22 chipset with 2 gb ram. phone comes with so many pre loaded apps which you can disable. this phone sucks in multitasking. you can play small games on it. xiaomi will improve it is performance with miui 10 update.(miui 10 beta is already out and works fantastic) ● battery(9/10): it has decent 3000 mah battery which gives you whole day power for moderate usage. other specifications which are impressive at this price: 1. ai face unlock 2. dual volte 3. dual sim slot + memory card slot cons: no fingerprint scanner overall rating : 8.5/10 with such a low price tag it is best mobile in the market. you can definitely buy it. recommended.
