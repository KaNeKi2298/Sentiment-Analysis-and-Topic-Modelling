this is my first iphone i was a long time android user but after using this iphone my views have been completely changed for androids after using ios or iphone i have realised that iphone is much better than android in terms of display,camera,speed the iphone works seamless i mean the speed is very good the battery is okay if you dont play games the battery will run for a whole day in a single charge 2-the camera is mind blowing 3- the phone processor speed is great cons 1- the battery drains fast when you play games or if you keep bright display light then also battery will not be able to keep it for a whole day

the battery life was better than previous iphones but cannot take the competition from other phone available in the market it gives you one day(15 hrs approx) backup with moderate usage, it catches scratch very easily specially on its metal rim, screen was awesome, sound is also superb, camera is not upto mark, too much heating issues after upgrading ios 12.1. not a value for money.

* great display * ergonomic design * excellent camera from apple * great battery life ( charge time is a factor ) * no lagging issues * similar to iphone xs only difference is a12 chip in xs and a11 in x * great buy from prime sale with display insurance from amazon perk if you are an apple lover like me and you want to upgrade from older versions of iphone at the same time similar look as 2019 xs then this is your best choice.

i was contemplating between iphone x and xs when the big indian sale was here, as the difference between two was around 10-12 k but as i was already spending a lot i did not feel like spending any more and got the x. i am absolutely satisfied with the phone as the camera is amazing but the biggest difference which i noticed (coming from 6s) was the screen, as oled makes a huge difference.

i picked up the iphone x recently and here is the changes i noticed, a) better typing experience on iphone x b) immersive display when watching video and reading text / better than iphone 8 c) camera is as good on both phones despite iphone 8 having just one camera.
