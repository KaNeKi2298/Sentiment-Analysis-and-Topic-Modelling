after using this phone for a month or so, i realize that i actually downgraded from lenovo k4 note to lenovo k8 note. why is it that the newer versions of phones be deprecated with smart features existing in older phones ?? all the 'feature phone' options from k4 are missing in k8 - that is pathetic. inbetween acquisitions (moto & lenovo), why is that you want to change lenovo phone ui to use the moto ?? that is very disappointing. I am a lenovo fan for ui and i go for lenovo phone. if i were moto fan i would go for moto phone. moto ui is very rigid and no options to change the style. for ex. the video files are displyed in list format, not a preview big images as in lenovo k4. please please lenovo consider this. now I am planning to change phone to other. levnovo can you please list out what all features have to taken out from k4 to k8 ?? this is very disappointing experience. you say the turbo charger, charge phone in few mins... but even after 1/2 hr of charging i see only 4-5 % increase at times !!

please do not buy this lenovo mobiles in this the company regularly provides the updates and also give such updates that after the guarantee period if you update then the phone will get damage in such as way that the service center will give us the reason that you phone is damage by water. i had faced this problem exactly after a year even after contacting the company directly they do not accept inspite the instrument is clean and there is no sign of damage they are saying it it is damage by water and need to change the mother board and the cost is equal to the cost of new mobile. that is also they are giving at concessional rates. so i would suggest not to buy the lenovo products.

excellent display, super fast charging, great feel ad very fast. easily handles many apps open at the same time and heating issues are not a bother too. sound is nice but beware it has only 1 speaker although there are two grills on the body of the phone. cannot understand why lenovo did this . the phone has already got latest oreo update, along with enhancements to sound, performance and camera. camera is great at this price band. the biggest issue is that it does not support dual 4g standby as described in the specs. only one sim will become 4g while the other will shift to 3g/2g. that is ridiculous. i bought it on seeing the features shown on the product page saying "dual 4g dual standby", however its a total disappointment there. should have put proper description. overall a very good phone if you take away the negatives regarding dual standby and speakers.

so apparently, if your charger cable degrades, you have to shell out rs 1500 to replace your mobile charging port too. why you ask? because they can not connect phone to pc using "broken" cable (not any other working cable, because that is against their policy), so they diagnosed that charging port too must be faulty. i am amused how many ways people come up with to cheat customers.

it has been more than 1 year and 4 months using this phone. brought this phone at 14k. specifications looked good. first 6 month it was decent phone. just when it was about to complete 6 month turbo charger did not worked. lucikly it was within exact 6 month it got replaced for free. then after couple of months came the oreo update and phone battery started draining very quickly. lenovo gave another update after 15-20 days which solved the issue. but still there are bluetooth, wifi connectivity issue. i cant use wireless bluetooth headphones because of lag in it. then just 2 days ago phone got hanged and is not able to start. after visiting service center they told me its software issue and we dont have update for it you need to wait 15 - 20 days. so till i dont get update its useless phone. also, this phone price is today is around 30 % down and max is 3k so very little value on exchange of phone. so my final call will be dont buy it. edit : update after 1 month later i was told its mother board had issue. i was surprised to hear this because it never had fallen no physical damage then how motherboard gets issue. you need to pay rs. 8000 but we would suggest buy new phone instead which will cost around same. today 02 jun 2019, i got notification from amazon that my review has been voted by 10 people. thats why i am updating my review. after reading reviews i found many are facing same issue of motherboard and phone hangs and shows lenovo logo. so i would really suggest dont fall for trap of avg rating of 3.4. if we could give 0 as rating then avg would fall below 2. 43 percent of people have given 3 or below 3. i feel number of 4 and 5 is higher because people immediately review it after purchase they dont wait for at least 1 year to check the quality. so my really request would be dont buy this cheap quality phone.

this is the number one crap product that ever purchased. intially started restarting automatically and it was dead after some time. took it to the marathahalli service centre and agian i was told that they dont accept the waranty mobi es and routed to indira nagar. they showed lot of resistance in accepting under waranty. finally they accepted and serviced it after two weeks. they said that motherboard is gone and we replaced the same. after the service the impactedthings is signal catching and voice quality. i have to tell 100 times the same word for others to understand. ceratinly dont have time to keep on roaming arround the service centre.will try to make some time this week. overall very bad exeprice with the lenovo hamd set and service aswell.

bought this mobile in jan'18. initially performance was good but after oreo update battery performance was pathetic. battery drains very very fast and last 15% goes in just 15 seconds. i asked for support from customer care and as guided by them i visited their service center wherein they did something (not to mention that i lost all the data during this process) and told me that now it will work fine. but in reality nothing improved, battery still drains very fast, specially last 15%. if I am watching online video last 15% drains in just 3-4 seconds, if I am on call then it takes approximately 7 seconds to drain, if I am working online then it runs for 10 seconds and if i keep it idle it takes maximum 15 seconds to fully drain. my personal recommendation is to avoid this mobile set for good. one more thing to add here, net will not work on any other mobile / laptop if we share net through its hotspot. other handset's / laptop's wifi will detect and connect to this handset's hotspot but no matter what you do net will not run on other mobile / laptop.

delivered as i was expected...dolby atmos sound is outstanding...camera is nice...smooth running because of stock android...there is some issues in oreo update..don't update it next version...battery draining problem because of deca core process as well as mediatek cpu used.heating issue because of 10 core cpu & hello p22 chip used. beacuse of 10 processor and 4 gb of ram and expanded memory of to 1 tb ( found in k8 note brochure) , this will be a little laptop without any hassal. battery backup is good. some people says that mi phones are better than k8 note but if you know how to properly use a phone then you will find lenovo k8 note is the king of all phones of 10k to 15k segment.

i have recently bought this phone and just few days only.... however my observations as follows performance wise the phone is quite good and amazing display no doubt about it. however overall I am not very happy with this phone for the following reasons 1) even though there is dual camera power packed with pixels but still noting great with the photos as compared with other phone cameras specially with the manual settings 2) there is no inbuilt gallery app, sound recording app, music player or note pad app or face recognition... even if u download a sound recording app it will only record the outgoing voice not the incoming voice of a call. 3) the proximity sensor sometimes does not work.... while on call something or the other gets activated. I am sure I will find out something more extensive use of this phone.

writting review after using for 5 months. pros: 1. good battery backup. no matter what you do, it will last throughout the day. 2. nice sound quality. 3. the camera performance is great in abundant light but pathetic in low light. cons: 1. lenovo says the device has a gorilla glass, my device fell from my bed and the screen has h vertical line from the top to bottom. 2. lenovo says the device has a very good deca core processor, you can go for gaming but when it comes to performance other devices in similar range is way better than this while gaming. 3. despite having the highest variant of the device provided by the company, they will not change the device or provide proper support if you are facing an issue. 4. i have rarely used 2 sims in my device and the other sim tray has stopped working.

its been like a month since i bought this phone. the device is really worth its price. but when you compare it to the similar variants, it has a few draw backs. first of all, lets talk about the plus points. the screen resolution is really great with the 401 dpi/ppi resolution fhd screen. also the touch sensitivity is really awesome too.the fingerprint sensor is the advanced type, with a quick recognition system, and you can add upto five different finger prints. the camera quality is also great with front selfie flash and back blash , with the depth enabled mode, the pictures can run upto 12mb for one picture. the 13+5 mp rear camera and 13 mp front camera is really satisfying. the corning edges is quites2 a thing for its design quality. the screen is scratch resistant and the device is water spill proof. the charging port is quite rigid and the charger fits right with no discrepancies. the device comes with its own back cover which is also good. the notification lights on the device can be adjusted for your preference. during the first weeks, the device was having such a great battery backup and later on it began to drop. even though the product comes with 4000 mah battery, it canonly be used for upto 7 hours full browsing on the net, or one whole day normal use. the device has a slight heating problem during browsing, but does not heat up while watching videos or calling. it even doesnt heat up while charging. the deca core processor is really promising with quick launching of applications and fast computing. the device also provides split screen.the 4 gb ram is really useful and 64 gb rom is quite enough for a normal usage. during ma experience , after using some certain applications on the device. i have found out that instagram crashes while using. it also comes with a music key, which can be assigned for any quick functions like turning on flash light or quick play music etc. in my opinion the product is really worth its price and the user interface is user friendly with advanced features.

i had not had any phone working this good after an year. but, there are few pros and cons which i will elaborate : pros :- 1. never hangs- the 10core processor and stock android performs excellently. 2. battery life-changing even after an year, the battery performance is decent. it does not drain out. 3. camera-the photos are decent and the secondary camera does perform very well in daylight or proper lighting conditions. 4.build quality-this is the best thing. i have honestly thrown the phone many times(even screen facing), but there is not a single sent or damage on it. 4.timely upgrades-lenovo does offer timely upgrades for this phone. cons:- 1.heating issue-the phone does heat up when playing heavy games (like pubg) but it is still manageable. 2.camera-the low light performance is not satisfactory. you notice grains and color difference. the depth effect is really bad i must say. 3.the back panel-the back panel is aluminium and is very slippery. cannot imagine the phone without using a cover as it can easily slip. overall, i have not been bored of this phone yet. and even after 14+ months of using, i think there is no good competitor for it in 10k price range. it still beats many. a comeback phone from lenovo, and it does perform very well.

hello friends, I am not a extreme technical person to review the technical factors of the device. I am not a much device lover to expect all better qualities rather i wish only for a better battery backup. phone battery capacity is 4000 mah which means users expect high in battery quality but this phone is not giving good battery backup. I am a very minimal user i do not even carry my mobile outside and always keep in data off mode still I am not having enough battery backup all this happened after upgrading to oreo version. please see the complaints at lenovo forum and judge your decision to buy. my recommendation is not to prefer this because I am giving this review after using it for 7 months thanks

best phone at best price...... phone functioning is smooth just like "makkhan", at this price tag i think this phone prove to be value for money. battery life is good, goes almost a day for average calling & data usage. but for heavy caller & data usage it may work max 6-7 hrs a day. little bit heating issue faced while charging, but leaving this thing apart its a best mid-range value phone between 10-15k...

great performance, good camera, good battery and good looks. it could have been a great mobile but lacks few features like screen cast (only through chromecast), camera can be improved for low light, memory and power could be better. fir the price point it is definitely a great mobile phone. lenovo should keep working on it to make it a game changer.

it is an ok phone but the description is wrong and misleading. for example, it says li-polymer battery but actually the phone has li-ion battery which is a dated tech and much less expensive. i wish to take the seller to the consumer's court for putting up wrong information on the item in order to exaggerate its value.

its performance is very bad,battery took 4 to 5 hours time to full charge and discharge took same time.camera is ok but no special options available for editing like as sony. for this product cost is too high not reasonable (8k is suffiecient). no earphones packed hence my suggestion is dont purchase this phone.

within 1 month of use, started hanging. one major draw back, it does not support miracast function. so you can not connect it to your smart tv. surprisingly youtube can be shared with tv. so they are forcing us to buy chromecast.
