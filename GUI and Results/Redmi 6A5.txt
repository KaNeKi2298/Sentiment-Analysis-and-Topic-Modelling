i have gifted this phone to my mom...she has been using it for the last 4-5 months and she is quite happy with the handset, so here are the pros and cons she has experienced over this period of time - pros 1. front camera is quite good in this price range...daylight images are noteworthy with good saturation n sharpness 2. rear camera is fair in well lit places but in low light conditions create some noise in the images but with flash it can be reduced to a certain level 3. screen display is good at this price range...processor speed is also fair enough considering you are not planning to play any rich graphics game 4. call quality nd network is good cons 1. sound is very low - both during calls and music 2. loudspeaker is of poor quality 3. battery life could have been better - with moderate usage of call and data it lasts a max of 9 hours
Score is: 0.9787

pros : 1. it is stand by time is amazing 2. screen quality is good although not clearly visible in direct sunlight 3. dual 4g works like a charm 4. back camera is decent, good for the price 5. it has dedicated micro sd card slot so memory is not a problem cons : 1. screen on time is bad redmi y2 also has a 3000 mah battery but it is battery life is far better than this 2. front camera is not good in low light 3. the speaker is terrible.

so, i purchased this phone for my mom, and it is a good phone overall for limited users like parents who do not use much apps on their phone the picture quality of this phone is quite decent for its price point, and same goes for the battery life one thing that is bugging me is that the speakers are at back, which degrade the sound quality of it, rest this phone is flawless for limited usage :))

Score is: 0.4497

sound quality is not good...its much worse because of the speaker facing backwards.....mediatek processors are known for heating and battery issues...and yet they used mediatek processor.... compromising the processor lowered the price...other than that, redmi 6a is an awesome mobile phone with no lagging issues...great screen quality...3000 mah battery... and a good camera for the price
