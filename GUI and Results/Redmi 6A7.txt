xiome has become unbeatable king of budget phones.. you cannot expect a better product in this range.. good for those who are switching from feature phone to smart phone and dont expect much from their phone.. totally worth the money.. if someone looking for better hardware and a bit strong build, i would advise to go with moto products which will cost 1000-2000 bucks more..
