i had a big expectations from this mobile and this time i just ignore other big brand which is available in the market with same or better configuration .camera quality not good .picture are not so impressive ,sound quality also not so great .while calling you need to stick phone to your ear closely .noisy area the sound is not at all audible .heating problem with this mobile and getting drain very fast .i have not downloaded much application except paytm but still phone battery is lasting for 4-5 hours .overall not happy at all with this phone
