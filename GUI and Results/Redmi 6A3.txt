the phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c1 adding 1000 buck do not buy it for the user's who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people but if you are gamer dont buy it really sucks !!!

i have gifted this phone to my mom...she has been using it for the last 4-5 months and she is quite happy with the handset, so here are the pros and cons she has experienced over this period of time - pros 1. front camera is quite good in this price range...daylight images are noteworthy with good saturation n sharpness 2. rear camera is fair in well lit places but in low light conditions create some noise in the images but with flash it can be reduced to a certain level 3. screen display is good at this price range...processor speed is also fair enough considering you are not planning to play any rich graphics game 4. call quality nd network is good cons 1. sound is very low - both during calls and music 2. loudspeaker is of poor quality 3. battery life could have been better - with moderate usage of call and data it lasts a max of 9 hours
