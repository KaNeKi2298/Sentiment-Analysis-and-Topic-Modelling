i find the display best even better than smasung due to natural colours samsung phone are very oversaturated even though they also use samsung display a thing you realise when you send someone a pic before buying something and when you reach they realise color look nothing like on there phone.

colours are spot on, the true tone display needs some time to get used to but later there is no turning back to the normal mode.

this is my first iphone i was a long time android user but after using this iphone my views have been completely changed for androids after using ios or iphone i have realised that iphone is much better than android in terms of display,camera,speed the iphone works seamless i mean the speed is very good the battery is okay if you dont play games the battery will run for a whole day in a single charge 2-the camera is mind blowing 3- the phone processor speed is great cons 1- the battery drains fast when you play games or if you keep bright display light then also battery will not be able to keep it for a whole day

* great display * ergonomic design * excellent camera from apple * great battery life ( charge time is a factor ) * no lagging issues * similar to iphone xs only difference is a12 chip in xs and a11 in x * great buy from prime sale with display insurance from amazon perk if you are an apple lover like me and you want to upgrade from older versions of iphone at the same time similar look as 2019 xs then this is your best choice.

the original iphone x is still considered one of the best smartphones ever made,even after a successor xs has launched,it is still a better buy as the processor in iphone x is literally much faster than any android phones out there so speed is not a query ,battery life still seems reasonable ,and the display is so crisp and awesome even with that huge notch ,face id works greats although a dedicated fingerprint sensor would be nice ,my final verdict iphone x is still a great buy compared to iphone xs and xr due to its drop in price ,but the better choice is this https://www.amazon.in/gp/offer-listing/b0711t2l8k/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeasin=b0711t2l8k&linkcode=am2&tag=techstore01-21&linkid=a58094adb066087bad018f471672e0e7
