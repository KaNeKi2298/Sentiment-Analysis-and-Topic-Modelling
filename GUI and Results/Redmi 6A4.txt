sound quality is not good...its much worse because of the speaker facing backwards.....mediatek processors are known for heating and battery issues...and yet they used mediatek processor.... compromising the processor lowered the price...other than that, redmi 6a is an awesome mobile phone with no lagging issues...great screen quality...3000 mah battery... and a good camera for the price
Score is: 0.2153

no overheating issue.good speaker volume.camera is ok(could have been better).battery will not drain even with one full day moderate usage.feels light & compact in hand with nice build quality.no specific complaints as such.overall nice phone considering the price tag.
