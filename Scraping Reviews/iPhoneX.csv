The phone is faulty. do not buy this product. It heats up so fast so that we can’t even hold it in our hand. Return was not possible. Apple technical support is not helpful either,21 Jan 2019,Phone heating up so fast,1.0 ,SS
"This is my 4th IPhone X purchase all in used in family and bought first on launch day in India and last one in October 2018 but still and I have bought and used oneplus to pixel 2Xl along the period and while both those phone are good but I am 100 percent you won’t enjoy them and they won’t last and work as smooth as iPhone X , I bought this phone from 89k on launch till 62k in prime day sale after all discounts and I can say at 65 it’s awesome buy. I find the display best even better than smasung due to natural colours Samsung phone are very oversaturated even though they also use Samsung display a thing you realise when you send someone a pic before buying something and when you reach they realise Color look nothing like on there phone. Battery is good for me 6-7 screen on time but never enough but still it’s good compared to competition. This phone is made of glass hence I use skin and a case and I still prefer glass as I enjoy wireless charging. It’s the most premium looking peace of tech I own . This phone keeps getting faster with every update something no android can compete with. I will suggest you buy AirPods along with the phone an awesome experience together. XR is also good buy if you value camera over display.",20 Dec 2018,Best phone under 65k even in 2019,5.0 ,Honest Reviews
"The phone is simply awesome- The display, the smoothness, the feel in the hand is so premium. But what really annoys is lack of Fast charger and its cable is Cheap quality. Pricing is always an issue with apple. But the phone is really awesome. Accessories are on cheaper side quality wise. Needs protection to the most as any breakage will cost you a huge amount. One thing more- The packaging of the phone was pathetic. Didn't expect this from amazon. Cheap quality packing.",12 Oct 2018,Awesome phone with small disappointments,4.0 ,Ashish Gupta

"Apple has always been a coin with 2 sides, it has loyal followers who will swear by it and it has loyal critics who will feed of it. Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and it’s features and not compare with other models. Pros- - Its truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it. - the build quality is amazing. It’s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, it’s like opening a Pandora’s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course it’s an year old now) - the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later there’s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great. -the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer. -the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time. - Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , it’s good. Although it’s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!) - The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. It’s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesn’t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but don’t let numbers fool you. Cons- - battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, that’s what power banks are there for. - headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!! U will have to carry the connector all the time or leave it attached to ur headphones all the time to avoid forgetting them in a hurry. These are just a few points I have noticed after using the phone for sometime, will update if I feel anything is needed.",29 Oct 2018,Truly a phone which will leave an impression,5.0 ,Syed
"This is my first iphone i was a long time android user but after using this iphone my views have been completely changed for androids after using ios or iphone i have realised that iphone is much better than android in terms of display,camera,speed the iphone works seamless i mean the speed is very good The battery is okay if you dont play games the battery will run for a whole day in a single charge 2-The camera is mind blowing 3- the phone processor speed is great Cons 1- the battery drains fast when you play games or if you keep bright display light then also battery will not be able to keep it for a whole day",16 Jan 2019,Great just great,5.0 ,KUNAL DOGRA

"The battery life was better than previous iphones but can't take the competition from other phone available in the market it gives you one day(15 hrs approx) backup with moderate usage, it catches scratch very easily specially on its metal rim, screen was awesome, sound is also superb, camera is not upto mark, too much heating issues after upgrading ios 12.1.

"I purchased iphone X on 26th Oct'18 and started using from 28th Oct'18. When i received the product, it was already opened which i informed Amazon representative but i was told that it is original product and it will not have issue. Within two days, it started giving me issue with network & WiFi connectivity. I again contacted Amazon through app but i was directed to Apple support. After talking to Apple representative, i only got indefinite answer like it could be software issue and i should wait till it updates but Amazon return/replace policy valid for only 10 days. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon.",31 Oct 2018,Amazon Return support is too poor,1.0 ,Amazon Customer
"This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus. Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it. Pros: - I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy. - It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K. - Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12. - The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones. - Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser. Cons: - The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later. - The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector - Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly. - Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max. - The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely. - With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.",12 Oct 2018,"An amazing deal at INR 69,999/-",5.0 ,ShowrobDa
"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine. iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!! Pros: 1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it 2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking 3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901. Cons: 1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!) 2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8. 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.",11 Oct 2018,Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!,5.0 ,Ktron

"When you say its ""Apple I Phone"" it is the most coveted phones available in the market. Every time Apple release's a new phone there is a lot of buzz around the phone, but honestly speaking it stands up to all the hype and expectation created around it. Was earlier using I phone 6 now decided to upgrade my self to I Phone X, the delivery of ordered product was much faster then expected. Thanks Amazon - The minute you hold the phone in your hand it feels so Premium, the build quality is Excellent but also don't forget to order Tempered screen guard + Back cover for the phone, since you have spent a bomb on the phone and front and back is made up of Glass. - The entire Packaging of the phone is brilliantly designed and is very very impressive, the way earpods are packedand placed, Charging adapter & cable is packaged etc etc... even the most minutest details have been taken care of. - Apple thankfully has taken care of the the battery which is indeed much better then its predecessors, a single charge of 100% in my case stayed easily for around 10-12 hrs, which in Iphone 6 used to be 6-8hrs [I don't have to carry my charger any more :) ] - The HD Clarity of the screen is to die for so Crisp and super vibrant, the speaker quality is loud and sharp even with full volume there is no Jarring sound. Very happy with the Phone and super fast delivery :)",17 Apr 2019,One of the best Phones I have had till date,5.0 ,Harsha Kamath
iPhone X is like no other phone out there. Is a manifesto go-to phone for premiumness. Class apart in a nutshell. The security of iPhone is amazing as always. The camera is top notch and portrait mode is the best any camera offers. There are so many inbuilt AR apps which take the game to the outer space. The battery life is quite good as well. With heavy use it’s been able to last more than 12-14 hours. No heating issues. Supports siri and amazon alexa as well out of the box. Though it is a very slippery phone so first don’t forget to get a heavy phone cover. Only if you use you will realise why this phone is expensive and as always nothing comes closer to apples interface.,30 Dec 2018,Worth Every Cent!! love it Apple😍😍,5.0 ,Shivi Bhatia
"My first ever iphone and this much expensive purchase from Amazon and i was literally doubtful if i should purchase this online. Now its been almost 1 month that i am using this (thanks amazon for the wonderful delivery and the seller Appario retail pvt ltd for building the trust) and trust me its worth every penny. I got an authentic product with earphones, charger and a connector, you can check it as well on imei24 and official apple website. It feels so premium in hands and very handy as compared to other latest phones. Yes i agree its very expensive but its worth it. I was a android user till now and i wanted a change so i decided for iphone X and i think i will be an apple user for life now lol. It will take you some time to explore the features as it is much different from Android but it's fun. Face recognition works like a charm and overall it is really fast so 3GB works same like the 8 GB RAM on the other phones.. Camera take the real and natural pictures with beautiful colors without fake filters and all. It is much more secure than the android phones. Battery backup might not be the best but its not that bad as well. Overall i would say its a great product and if you are bored from using andorid and need a change and also if you love luxury, Go for this. First month went really good, let's see how will be experience in coming months, i might change my review accordingly then lol.",27 Nov 2018,Worth the purchase,5.0 ,Milind Ahuja

Actually I was too scared to buy such an expensive phone from online portal though i had trust over amazon but still after reading negative comments It scared me. At the end Because of price difference I bought this through Amazon and overall experience was great Firstly the extra secure steps bu amazon was impressive and also the delivery person just told me you can open the box and he will stay there and make a video After opening the box I checked the serial number if I phone was pre activated however it was brand new with no pre activation Though I had some issues while i Updated to new software for which I had to go to apple care but the query was resolved in 15 min Overall I am quite happy with phone performance and bought at damn cheap price than store,03 Nov 2018,Great phone,5.0 ,Nikunj

The device (iPhone X) is best in camera and battery performance. But I am posting this review for Amazon’s quick delivery. I ordered this product in night around 11:00 pm and got the phone very next day in the morning. Isn’t it amazing. I cannot trust any other e-commerce website if I am buying such an expensive device as I already heard a lot also have seen a real incident in my office where a box is delivered having a marble inside of a Samsung phone box.

"Was quite confused whether to go with iPhone X or the Xs. Finally went ahead with the X and I can say I made the right decision, coming from an iPhone 7 it felt a huge upgrade for me. Face ID works great for me not even once I used my passcode till date. Cameras, well for the videos they’re the best no competition whatsoever, for photos they’re one of the best if not the best available in the market.

"Great device as always from Apple. This iPhone X is awesome in every specification. I’m upgrading from iPhone 6s and loving it. * Great Display * Ergonomic Design * Excellent Camera from Apple * Great battery life ( charge time is a factor ) * No lagging issues * similar to iPhone XS only difference is A12 chip in xs and A11 in X * Great buy from prime sale with display insurance from Amazon perk If you are an Apple lover like me and you want to upgrade from older versions of iPhone at the same time similar look as 2019 XS then this is your best choice. Price is still on higher side but no regrets hopefully Apple makes their devices in India soon and consumers can escape from their higher price tags.

After shelling out so much amount on a mobile except for camera I don’t think this ones any better to galaxy s10 or other competitors like pixel... where a lot more is offered for a lesser price.

Easily gives me 7-7.5 hours of screen time on medium usage. Reason for giving 9 instead of 10 is, my phone’s battery capacity dropped to a whopping 3% in just a month after buying it. Although it is still at 97% and it has been almost 3 months since I bought it.) Wireless charging works good. The phone doesn’t heat other than occasionally warming up, which is pretty usual I guess.

"This phone is absolute beauty. I am using this for past one month. This is my first iPhone and mind you i have become its Fan. I'll give a detail review under following heads :- 1. Overall Look : This phone looks extremely classy and with gorgeous glass back, from front as well looks very stylish and it speaks volume about itself. 2. Screen : The screen is wonderful, the touch is very responsive. Picture quality on screen is also amazing. 3. Speed : One of the fastest phone available in the market. Although with launch of Xs still this phone is very fast and is much faster than many other phones available in mkt. 3. Camera : Very Fine dual back Camera it gives good quality of pictures, Front camera is again very impressive Crystal clear puctures. Im not comparing it with DSLR but given this is a phone, its ip there. Potrait mode can be improved. But not a bad output. 4. Battery life is ok ok won't say a very great given the price of the phone, but if u caompare with Xs there isn't any much difference. 5.

The problem has been persisting and the swindling Apple guys are replacing the front part again and again, and not replacing my phone. My phone has been in the service centre for more than 3 months now. I have supporting documents too to support my argument. I am going to the consumer court. My recommendation: Avoid Apple products, rather go for Samsung or Huawei or One Plus, as they provide better service than this $1 trillion company who just bilks money out of everyone. RIP APPLE.

"I got the phone during the Great Indian Festival Sale and made use of the price drop as well cash backs. Kudos to Amazon for that. Coming to the phone, I can truly justify the purchase at the price point I got it for and have no major issues whatsoever. I have been using iPhone 7 since two years and the screen is a big upgrade as compared to it, the size isn't that big and adds more than inch to Screen real estate. In real life usage, I didn't find the phone to lag anytime and feels fast, smooth and very responsive. The display is great as expected from an AMOLED and I noticed an increase in the battery life as well. iPhones typically, should be treated as an investment and not a product to show off. I am a power user and this serves all my needs very well. I am pretty sure that Apple will continue to support this product for quite a few years down the line as well therefore, went for the iPhone X instead of the iPhone XS.",09 Nov 2018,Still a powerhouse of a phone,4.0 ,Pranav Chawla

"Hi Amazon India, Reminder - 2 I purchased Iphone X having details as below , 1. Fact: This Phone bought by me on 16th July 2018, and having warranty till 15th July 2019. Warranty and Invoice attached. 2. Issue : This phone got damaged and while visiting official Iphone store found that this phone waspurchased originally on 3rd Feb 2018 hence warranty expired. Hence now stuck between Amazon & Apple. 3. This case registered with Apple and case ID is 100849584322, Screen Shot attached Serial No : FRNVXR95JCLF 4. Since there is a clear case fraud with me, I want Amazon India to pay me in full amount equal to original invoice what i paid or provide me the New Phone ( this time original & genuine one) 5. Attachments A. Screen shot from Apple India that Phone purchase date is not the 16th July 2018 B. Original Invoice and warranty issued from Amazon India- which is not right and fraud conducted C.

Amazon delivery from Appario Retail is genuine product. Pros: 1. Primary Camera video quality is excellent in 4K 2. Photo and portrait mode is excellent. 3. Screen and audio quality is awesome. Cons: 1.video recording in 4k consume very high storage (1 minute video = 1 GB) 2. Secondary selfie camera quality is average. 3. Low Battery backup and Charging cable is average quality. My suggestion is please consider 256 GB IPHONE X if you record video frequently. Also check seller review before buying online specially in UP & Bihar as some delivery man may temper packages.

"iPhone X has been great to use. The first thing that comes to my mind is a good speed and long battery life that it has. What not good about it is the cost to maintain the phone. So I did not buy the insurance thinking that I will manage the repairs without getting an insurance. But one fine day I dropped the iPhone X and the back glass of the phone was damaged. So I went to Apple Care to replace it since its looking shabby. To my surprise, I got to know that the BACK GLASS is not replaceable and that to solve this issue you will have to replace the whole phone which will cost Rs.54000 which does not make sense. So one thing is clear that replacing parts are damn expensive and you should buy an Apple protection plan which will cover your phone from liquid and phone damage which you can buy for merely Rs. 8000. I checked these rates in Pune.",05 Jul 2019,Get an Apple protection plan also with it without fail.,3.0 ,Justin George

Its simply an iphone!!! If you are into ios ecosystem then it is simply the best iphone in terms of price to utility ratio. U get best amoled screen. Top most superior build quality. Stainless steel is simple luxury. Non ios users will also feel the premiumness just on seeing this and holding it. Face id is better than touch id in terms of usability. Literally no one can sneak into ur phone if u know how to use face id properly. Only thing that slightly lets is down is battery life. It goes for around a day easily but don’t expect anything more from the battery. All in all simply the best phone ever.

Really a flagship premium phone. Now I know why it costs almost one lac. Buy this instead of iPhone xs and xr. Great battery life. Feels wow in hand. Apply any case this phone looks great. Face id is top notch. Camera is fabulous. Especially portrait mode. Invest in this instead of Xs and xr.,25 Oct 2018,A new breed of iPhone.,5.0 ,Prashant
"I used several iPhone models like iPhone SE, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 for pairing with Apple watch Cellular in the past 5 months and have finally arrived with best combo with iPhone X. Thanks to Amazon, the supplier and SBI I could get the best price for the phone. The phone with IOS 12.01 and the cellular watch works like a dream.

"There are much better devices at lesser prices. I understand people would still buy Apple devices. I really admire Apple for their iPad and Macbook. I have used iPhones in the past and used to think Android devices are substandard,but once I switched to Samsung Note 8, it just blew my mind. Fell in love with the display right away. There are very things to complain about even with Note 9 and it costs 30k lesser. That amount makes a significant difference.",30 Oct 2018,Better go for premium Android like Note 9,2.0 ,Bodhisattva

After buying I-phone I quenched my thirst of having it. But within a short time i realised that i have done a grave mistake and have fallen prey to this overpriced and hollow symbol of status. I asked myself as to why inpurchased this phone ? I got the following genuine answer 1. To satisfy my false ego of having it . 2. To show other people the LOGO No doubt the phone works good . But the COST to BENEFIT ratio is humongous. No sane person would buy it until he is a millionaire and have no regard for money. In one word IPHONE = EGO,11 Oct 2018,Why??,4.0 ,Amazon Customer
"I bought the iPhone X and there was an issue with the display and brightness. I had to make weekly runs to the Apple repair centre to first show the phone, then back up data etc etc. There turned out to be a genuine issue, hence, I am not sure of the aunthencity of the gadgets sold on Amazon. I think it’s completely avoidable to purchase any electronic gadgets from Amazon India. I also bought a Panasonic tv and it turned out to be faulty - in less than one month. I would advise you to buy your products after verifying them in person at a Tata Croma instead",15 Sep 2018,Do not buy electronic items from Amazon,1.0 ,Neha

"I was contemplating between iphone X and XS when the big indian sale was here, as the difference between two was around 10-12 K but as i was already spending a lot I didn’t feel like spending any more and got the X. I am absolutely satisfied with the phone as the camera is amazing but the biggest difference which i noticed (coming from 6s) was the screen, as OLED makes a huge difference. Also, i recently compared the X with Xs and the only difference is if my app opens in 2 sec, it will take 1.8 sec. which does not justify 20k difference for me. No matter how good the phone is, there is no way this price can be justified. Apple really needs to understand, that if you will keep on increasing rates the way you are doing, no one will care about getting them anymore.",19 Jan 2019,Great phone but could have been cheaper.,4.0 ,Tushar mohla

"I have had an iPhone 8 for about 10 months now. It has been a pleasure to use. I picked up the iPhone X recently and here is the changes I noticed, a) Better typing experience on iPhone X b) Immersive display when watching video and reading text / better than iPhone 8 c) Camera is as good on both phones despite iPhone 8 having just one camera. iPhone X has the winning studio light feature. That's great but not having it is no deal breaker. Even if you come from an iPhone 7 or older iPhone than that, both cameras will blow you out of the water. d) Both have incredible all day battery life e) Both support Wireless Charging f) The iPHONE X has face ID which is gimmicky and inconvenient g) The iPhone X is supposed to have a better display but side by side you would not notice it. h) Both are very durable. But you are less likely to break the iPhone 8 as it is less slippery and perfectly ok to use without case. The iPhone X is too expensive to use without a good case. So consider how that will cost another Rs 1000-2000 or so. i) Equal in speed and performance as same processor j) Both are equally future proof k) Speaker is 10% louder on iPhone X but iPhone 8 is loud enough and very clear Overall, dear reader, please know that the difference in price at the time of writing this review is Rs 13,000. Would I recommend you paying the extra 13000 to get the iPhone X? I don't think so. At Rs 57000 the iPhone 8 64GB is a great deal. If you are worrying about running out of space, you can always pay Rs 200 a month and get 200+ GB cloud storage. So for less than Rs 3000 a year, you can avail cloud storage and make iPhone backups on cloud. I also want to say the iPhone X is a very good prospect at Rs 70,000 and is likely to last you 3 years. And at the end you will be able to sell for Rs 35,000 or so in the used industry. Same goes for iPhone 8. I went back to my iPhone 8, I am happy with it for now. I also feel this will last me another year or at least six more months. PLEASE NOTE : The iPhone 8 is not my primary phone. My primary phone is S9 Plus. If I had just one phone, I seriously would consider the iPhone X over the iPhone 8. So there you have it. Thanks for reading. Click helpful if you don't mind.

If we are paying such a high amount for these phones then they should not have these kinds of problems. Now amazon is not providing me with an option to get replacement but instead I have to go at apple service centre and submit my phone with them for 3-4 days.

Actually this is my first iPhone X my uncle bought it for me from his own account through Amazon it is a 256 GB edition Pros: 1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it 2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking 3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm’s chips has always been better than Intel’s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901. Cons: 1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!) 2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8. 3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking option Will come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks.,03 Mar 2019,A good experience for me since this is my first Apple iPhone,4.0 ,Amazon Customer
"the original iphone X is still considered one of the best smartphones ever made,even after a successor XS has launched,it is still a better buy as the processor in iphone X is literally much faster than any android phones out there so speed is not a query ,battery life still seems reasonable ,and the display is so crisp and awesome even with that huge notch ,face id works greats although a dedicated fingerprint sensor would be nice ,my final verdict Iphone X is still a great buy compared to Iphone XS and XR due to its drop in price ,but the better choice is this https://www.amazon.in/gp/offer-listing/B0711T2L8K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B0711T2L8K&linkCode=am2&tag=techstore01-21&linkId=a58094adb066087bad018f471672e0e7",12 Dec 2018,Better deal than the Iphone XS and XR,4.0 ,Tech reviews

Ignore my silver case! I was confused between Iphone X and Iphone XR but finally made decision to buy iphone X due to its best in class design and components and most importantly there’s no big difference between x & xs. Its been 5 month and I didn't face any type of issues & moreover having - 120 Hz touch-sensing capability the screen is really buttery smooth. Go for Iphone X blindly as Iphone XS & XR are just a minor ups and downs of X with few advancements that doesn't make much difference in your daily use.

"I'm speechless after using it for over a month now. This is a beautiful beast by Apple. It's expensive but it's worth every penny. This phone looks royal. Super royal. Display - I have seen many phones, but this display is rocking. It's crystal clean and super bright. It's amazing to see apple fit 5.8 inch in a phone that's barely bigger than iphone 6. This is an OLED screen which is pretty good in sun as well. Glass back - the glass back adds to the beauty and makes this stand out from the rest. It looks uber cool. Wireless Charging - A life saver. Buy a wireless charger and forget those charging wires forever. Water and dust resistance - It's not waterproof. So don't go swimming with it. but I liked the design, it's pretty good in being water resistant. Camera - oh boy. iPhone camera is super amazing. The pics are hi-res crystal clear and image stablization is high end. Camera modes are too good as well. Face ID - This has been a point of contention but it works like butter. Super smooth. I hardly have to key in the PIN once or twice a week. It recognizes in my face in specs, shades and even in a cap. Nothing else is required. I'm happy. Processor and speed - Can play anything on it. You just won't be disappointed with power and speed. Super awesome again. Verdict It's a royal device. Looks good on you. Keeps you happy. Works like charm. Just BUY it.

"If you are an apple snob you'll love it. EDIT: My old iphone was sold to crooks?! Good thing I'm not an idiot. I exchanged my iphone 6S for an iphone X. Was very happy. Now I got a call from some dumbo asking me for my id & password because he has bought my phone and needs to use it but needs MY iCloud id/password. I ask him how did he get my number-- he says the SELLER I sold my phone to gave him the number. I ask him to take it to an iPhone store to get it sorted. He disconnects call. Calls me two more times begging for id password. Third time threatens to take and ""misuse all my information"" on the phone. It's hilarious because my phone was reset and erased before I gave to the delivery person. So my contact details were given to this crook by someone at amazon delivery? If it was some layman or child they could have become victims of blackmail/extortion. Seriously amazon who are you guys hiring?! Who shared my contact details with these kinda people?

Amazing powerhouse machine with beautiful screen. However it is not free of cons. Here are few I noticed: 1. There is no official way of transferring Whatsapp chat history 2. Truecaller could not intercept calls to provide caller id 3. No native support for call recording 4. Deleting individual messages (SMS) is a hassle. Wish they could've provided same mechanism like delete conversation or other messages i.e. left swipe 5. Could not clear all notifications in one go. Right cross button to clear all appears after a while 6. Waiting for official wireless charger as could not find reliable reviews for other brand chargers I'm using Mac for around 4 years now and there is no software glitch I've observed. The purpose of getting iPhone was to get similar reliable OS and software performance which might take some time for Android to catch up and I'm highly satisfied till now.,18 May 2018,Awesome powerhouse machine,5.0 ,MaverickM

"This phone carries with itself great hype and consequently great expectations. In my experience, having had both the 8 plus and this, the main perceivable differences between both are in the size, the edge to edge display, front camera portrait mode, the absence of the home button, the new UI gestures and of course FaceID. How well are these implemented? • UI gestures- The new way of navigation is very well implemented and I have not experienced any difficulties in adapting to or using them The swipe up gesture to go home, swipe right and hold for multitasking etc are really easy and intuitive. People have been complaining about the control centre now a swipe down from the top right corner. But I ask how is this different from the notifications and quick toggle on Android which is also a swipe down from the top? With the new breed of 18:9 screen aspect ratio Android phones which are taller than ever before, this gesture is none the easier. I give it a score of 7.5/10 • FaceID- Works like a charm. The sensors are very forgiving of the angle but it won’t work if you’re holding your phone upside down or sideways. Apart from that, it works very well. It has a wide range of view. You don’t have to be dead centre in front of the phone for it to unlock. Works with sunglasses and spectacles and has no problem either in pitch dark or bright sunlight as long as the sun is not on your face or behind you. Prospective buyers shouldn’t have any apprehensions regarding it. Apple has given us a very good alternative to TouchID. It scores 8/10 • Front camera portrait- Nothing special. You have to try several times for it to give an acceptable result. Doesn’t compare well with the Pixel 2 phones. Yet, the skin tones on the iPhone are always far more natural than its Android counterparts. Doesn’t deserve more than 6/10 • OLED Display- You really have to look for differences between the IPS LCD of the 8 plus and the X. Apple does such a good job with the calibration of their displays that, frankly, I don’t see much difference in the quality of colours between the OLED iPhone X and the LCD 8 plus. Yes the OLED has more contrast compared to the LCD but if you’re looking to buy a phone purely for the punchy saturation and vividness of an OLED display, this is not it. You’d do well to look at the Samsung Note8. Apple always favours colour accuracy over vividness. The display quality deserves an 8/10 • Battery life is better than the 8 but worse than the 8 plus. There’s no competition. If you’re a heavy user, you will not get a full day’s use out of it. Plus, charging it is even slower than the 8 plus as the battery is actually bigger in size. Wireless charging is on board but is very slow in my experience. I have the Samsung fast charger that comes with the Note8 and use it to charge this phone. The battery scores 6/10. • Animoji- Fun if you spend too much time messaging people on iMessage. The novelty of it will wear off. The problem is that Apple has made us think it is some futuristic cutting edge tech built into its TrueDepth sensors when it actually isn’t. It is just using the front camera for face tracking and there’s no reason why it can’t be ported over to the 8 or older iPhones. But we know that is never going to happen. Apple will keep updating new characters to keep Animoji interesting. I give it a 5/10 because it is marketed as something which it isn’t. MY SCORE - 6.75/10 • FAQs- 1- How is the size and in-hand feel?- The size of the phone is much more manageable in one hand. The screen is narrower and gives less screen space than the plus model. It feels solid and premium in the hand. No creaking sounds yet. 2- How bad is ""The Notch""? - Doesn’t bother me anywhere outside Youtube videos or other video streaming platforms. It does cut into the video if you decide to expand the video to make full use of the available screen. It’s not noticeable in general usage like browsing, social media or messaging. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS- In my experience, one has to look at both the iPhone 8/8plus and the iPhone X in isolation to fully appreciate them. If one spends time comparing them, they’re bound to feel frustrated as there are far too many similarities to justify the huge price difference. If you’re someone who must have the shiniest offering from Apple, then the X is for you. But, if you want bang for your buck, then go for the 8 plus, as it is pound for pound the better phone between the two. The differences are simply not enough to justify spending extra. The camera performance, processor, RAM, storage options, apps, software features are the same and the X doesn’t offer as many extras that make it stand apart from its sibling. Maybe next year, Apple? IS IT WORTH IT?- There won’t be a cop out here. If you're contemplating between this and the 8 plus, in my opinion, to buy this phone, this year, at this price, is not worth it. (My purchase price was 87.5k). Even if you can afford it, or have an iPhone above the 6s/Plus, you can skip it without much remorse. iPhone 7/7 plus are still great phones and if you can hold off another year, then the 2018 lineup of iPhones is shaping up to be pretty exciting. Compared to the iPhone 8 plus, all the features this phone offers either looked at in isolation or even as a whole, do not justify getting it. Going forward, all iPhones are going to be designed like this and improve upon it. It’s not a limited edition model which is a must have. If this is going to be your first iPhone or if you're looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s, go ahead. It is a great phone and you won't regret getting it. I have put photos of the phone here. For the camera samples, please see my iPhone 8 plus review as there is no difference in photo quality between the two. Here is the link--- https://www.amazon.in/gp/review/R6DSET4ETOTXH/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8 X vs XS- The hardware upgrades between the X and XS are as follows- The speakers are slightly better, the camera records video in stereo mode, the water resistance rating has improved from IP67 to IP68, there is 4GB RAM now, the bokeh is adjustable in the portrait shots, Smart HDR takes multi frame pics like the Pixel 2, photos have much improved dynamic range and there’s a new gold colour. Apart from the camera improvements, there is not much that markedly improve your experience if you’ve been using the X the past year. Apple knows this too and have positioned the XS and XS Max as upgrades for people using older iPhones. (6, 6s, 7, 8) If you’re using any of these phones, the upgrade makes sense. iPhone X users are better off waiting till next year. Price update as on October 9, 2018- Since the 64GB iPhone X is now available at 69,990/- on Amazon, it is a better deal and worth considering for all those who have waited all this while and stayed away from the X due to the high price tag.",26 Jan 2018,"One Year later.

"I have never been so satisfied with battery life lately, but apple has gone beyond to work on this aspect. So far the battery life in iPhone X is exceeding expectation. The magic of iOS continues with extremely simple gestures and swift flow. Thanks to Amazon for delivering this device at my door step in less than 12 hours. Totally nailed it through Prime. I have been using this for last 5 days and so far there is no questions raised situation with me. Kudos guys. P.S - The product is very delicate.

"I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",05 Mar 2018,Beautiful designed iPhone by apple😍😍😍😍,5.0 ,Aftab khan

"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. Losing known, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone – and charging a lot more for the privilege – seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year. But the iPhone X is the handset we’ve been demanding from Apple for years – a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with. So… is the iPhone X worth having? Will it change the direction of an industry where many of the specs Apple has put in – wireless charging, bezel-less displays and face recognition – are already on the market?",01 May 2018,Does it Worth Your money?,4.0 ,Hari Parkash

Much has already been said about the phone but in my opinion it may sound a little expensive but when you get to use the phone you'll start to admire the attention to details which has been put in during designing and manufaturing of the phone. There is no other phone in the market which can match it's build quality. Ios has it's own disadvantages but when compared to android apple atleast provide full software support to its customers for 4 to 5 years unlike android where only 1.1% of the phones have oreo at this time.

I am iPhone user from last 6 years. I have had iphonex since last 2 weeks. But over the call I have made. I have had everyone says my voice is very faint or they doesn’t hear me at all. Is this software problem? I had discussion with online customer service representative and also at apple authorised service center and they did some diagnostic but it doesn’t worked.

"Hi This is a very good product under Rs82,999 and comes with 1 YEAR WARRANTY It is the best iphone I have ever seen . it has so much new features and look is amazing. It quality and condition is good. I really loved it. Below are some features and brief description about it. BRIEF DESCRIPTION:- Design and Display How do you create a deeply intelligent device whose enclosure and display are a single, uninterrupted element? That’s the goal we first set for ourselves with the original iPhone. With iPhone X, we’ve achieved it. With iPhone X, the device is the display. An all‑new 5.8‑inch Super Retina screen fills the hand and dazzles the eyes. The display employs new techniques and technology to precisely follow the curves of the design, all the way to the elegantly rounded corners. Front and Back Glass The front and back are all glass - the most durable we’ve ever made, with a strengthening layer that’s 50% deeper. A seven-layer ink process allows for precise hues and opacity, and a reflective optical layer enhances the colors. And an oleophobic coating lets you easily wipe off smudges and fingerprints. Wireless Charging for a Wireless World We’ve always intended iPhone to be a truly wireless device, free from charging cables and headphone cords. With a glass back and an embedded wireless charging system, iPhone X is designed for a wireless future. Water and Dust Resistance iPhone X is precision-engineered at the microscopic level to protect against water, splashes, and dust. OLED Designed for iPhone X The first OLED screen that rises to the standards of iPhone, with accurate, stunning colors, true blacks, high brightness, and a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio Improved Cameras A larger and faster 12MP sensor. A new color filter. Deeper pixels. And a new telephoto camera with OIS. The wide-angle and telephoto cameras on iPhone X enable optical zoom, as well as digital zoom of up to 10x for photos and 6x for videos. Face ID Face ID is enabled by the TrueDepth camera and is simple to set up. It projects and analyzes more than 30,000 invisible dots to create a precise depth map of your face. So Much Technology. In So Little Space The TrueDepth camera system allows you to take amazing photos and enables Face ID. It’s housed in a tiny space at the top of the display, yet within this miniaturized module are some of the most advanced technologies we’ve ever developed. FEATURES:- 1) 14.73 centimeters (5.8-inch) capacitive touchscreen with 2436 x 1125 pixels resolution 2) iOS v11.1.1 operating system with 1.3GHz Apple A11 Bionic hexa core processor, 3GB RAM, 64GB internal memory and single SIM 3) 2716mAH lithium-ion battery 4) 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase SO IF THIS REVIEW HELPED PLEASE VOTE IT HELPFUL.",12 Feb 2018,BEST iPHONE EVER IS iPHONE X,5.0 ,Aashutosh Singh

"This is by far the worst apple product I’ve ever used. You would expect your phone to be helpful in times of distress like an urgent call or message , but this IPhone X will be not unlock or just free maybe right @ that time. Face ID is the worst part about this phone! At night to unlock your phone, you have to get up and show your face with both eyes open for this thing to open. When complained to Apple to take their product back they say either live with it or let’s do diagnostic tests which didn’t help either way. This phone freezes every second day, I’ve never had to restart my phone so many times. I regret buying this phone",26 Feb 2018,Do not waste your money,1.0 ,Amazon Customer

"Since the day iPhone came out in 2007, I have used every other model starting from Original iphone, 3GS, 4, 5, 6, SE, and now the iPhone X, after the iPhone 6 (2016), i thought why not try out android, which i did in the most prestigious samsung Galaxy S7 which was a good change, but didn't quite liked it much, then came the much talked about one plus 3t, which was almost good (Better design all metal and probably sleeker) in comparison to the Samsung Flagship at the time (I am using MBP, iMac, Airport Extreme wireless connections to android are not seamless, neither do i have option of imessage, or taking up my phone calls on my laptop which is a big advantage of owning an IOS and a MAC OS device). I DID NOT HAD A NICE EXPERIENCE with android, so planned to move back to IOS, and at the time was skeptical on getting the iPhone 7 Plus, cause of the size, cause i like smaller phones, and knew how inconvenience it is to carry after OP3t so went for iPhone SE, which i still prefer to use over my iPhone X, it's just handy. Reachability i give you that, is a hindrance, but everyone is making phones bigger. Let phones be phones, you want bigger screen go buy ipads or other tablets, they offer excellent connectivity for sharing files. I know the whole point is to carry less on hand but, carrying something that barely fits your hand is also not convenient. My Experience with iPhone X, it's great, though it pinches to have spent this amount on a phone, but it just gets the job done, don't have to rely on unknown sources of softwares to connect to various things. People who have Apple products can understand this better.",02 Jan 2018,"iPhone X, You buy it, you'll love it. with T&C",5.0 ,Enkie

"What you see above is my Iphone X, previously i have used many other Iphones including SE, 6 and all, but this one ""oh my god "" this one is giving me so much headache it started before 2 months when my Iphone freezed for a period of 15 minutes and i was not even able to restart the device and after some times it resumed the activity. Before a few days the 3D touch was not functioning well and after talking with the adviser from apple i restarted the network settings and the 3D touch problem was solved but at night the problem resumed. Today one side of the phone suddenly changed its color by about 11 am and the whole screen is glitching on its own. I had so much of faith in you Iphone X, as i was a fan boy i didn't mind about the freezing because glitches are usual and now one of the costliest phone is malfunctioning by a lot i don't know what to say - Speechless",22 Aug 2018,Please be carefull,1.0 ,Vishnu

"I have recently ordered iPhone for my cousin and you can find below my review on the product based on a weeks usage. I will update this again after a month of use. Personally i have been a iPhone user for a long time now and yes i use Android phones also, because i am an app developer. iPhone X Pros - Size and design, iPhone X is an unbelievably designed device, that feels so sleek and handy. It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison. - Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera. - Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs - Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos. Cons - Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. It's a phone made for high class category only - If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check. Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android iPhone Pros - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great. - If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful - Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones. - Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not. iPhone Cons - Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories won't work well and perfect with iPhone - iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android - Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.",09 Jul 2018,"Complete review, Comparison with other devices, Brilliantly designed phone",4.0 ,Ajith Memana

Ok so there is a tip for any iphone users or who has an iphone 10 if you go to gym regularly n you do sweat alot then never keep your phone in the pocket it will make the microphone on the phone weak or make it bad like when you answer the phone call then voice of the receipent would not be audible you need to have sharp human listening skill inorder to understand what the other person is saying because the the sweat from the pocket reaches to the phone n screws with the microphone so NEVER PUT YOUR PHONE IN YOUR POCKET DURING GYM THE WHOLE TIME,03 May 2018,... the microphone on the phone weak or make it bad like when you answer the phone call then voice ...,4.0 ,Vishal

"I had previously purchased two iPhone X's from Flipkart and Croma, and so I was sure, they would send me new packages, but with Amazon I was skeptical. I am very thankful that I received a good and new product. I was very skeptical about purchasing from Amazon, as the reviews were mostly negative. But I got a brand new phone, which works perfectly without any issues. The camera is good, depth sensing is good. The images, are not over saturated and look very natural to the eyes. The colors are also very good. The FaceID works perfectly. All the passwords are stored on the iPhone and it just needs to recognize your face, and it will enter all the passwords directly into the field. Apple has thought and made the system to give the user a very nice experience. Very happy with my purchase.

"Update on 27-Dec-2017✍️✍️ This is my 6th week using iPhone X 64GB, I bought space grey colour which I felt much more elegant than the Silver. This is my upgradation from iPhone 6s to X. Below sharing my experience:- • The first attraction was bezel less phone. The screen size is 5.8 inch which is bigger than iPhone 8 plus (5.7”). However, the physical dimension of the phone is slightly bigger than my iPhone 6s. • The second attraction was Face ID, I was little bit hesitant in the beginning after going through so many online reviews. But I would say this is one of the techno marvellous thing done by Apple. Some of the key highlights of the Face ID:- - The ring volume diminishes immediately after it detects your face with the moment you look into the phone. The action is immediate. - You can set up more robust way to detect your Face ID under the settings of “Face ID & Pass Code” menu. - It works in low light, not an issue at all. - Although it hangs rarely as the same way legacy iPhone home button. In that case, need to use pass code. • Missing of Home button : There should not be any worry for this, It is more convenient without this, simply taping on the screen makes screen lit, and then need not hovering around for correctly pressing of the home button. • The camera is just extraordinary, the low light performance and true colour capture is supreme experience. I have attached two photos; one photo taken in the night in highway. Other is day light photo. Both are not processed. • Video : It is reported in other reviews that this iPhone series has only the capability of taking 60fps at 4K colour which stands the most capable phone camera for video. • Single handed operation : It is still possible easily. Please do a search in the net for how to do this. • Price : I don’t deny the fact that 89K rupees for 64GB is little pricy, it should have loaded 128 GB at least. However, I purchased this as combo offer with watch series 3 through one of the leading credit card offer. So, please watch out for some good deal if you really bother with the price. • Battery life : I found longer battery life than the iPhone 6s besides bigger screen size. I am high user of the phone with always data and Bluetooth on because using watch as well. It last almost full day. • Speed : It responds very fast not an issue at all. • Wireless charging: I am yet to check this properly, I tried in my 1A Qi charger it doesn’t work, you need 2A rating Qi charger • Speaker Quality : It is very loud and crisp. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ CONS:- I find only one issue as of now i.e., charging time • Charging time : It takes around 2 hours to charge fully from 10% level to 100% My final verdict: If you are looking for bezel free phone with decent battery life and superior camera, just go for this phone.",30 Nov 2017,"A revolutionary gadget, I simply like it",5.0 ,naba

"I received my X on launch day and I absolutely love this phone. If you would like a list of just my thoughts on the phone, scroll down pass the introduction. The transition: NO home button! The staple of the iPhone is gone; well, moved to a little notch at the top. I was expecting this transition to a home-button-less iPhone to be difficult, but all of the gestures feel so natural. I find myself annoyed trying to utilized an older iPhone as the interface now feels clunky. Switching through apps, opening the phone, accessing everything, it's all so easy. Now, this isn't to say there isn't a transition and while everything feels natural, there is a period of time where you have to get used to the new interface and some aspects that initially seemed difficult become second nature. For example, reachability was a favorite feature of mine and while it was initially hard to activate, I have now learned how to activate it without an issue (reachability brings the iPhone screen down halfway to reach top parts of the screen without moving your hand). Face ID: I was skeptical to say the least, but Face ID works (almost) perfect. It does however learn from its missteps and if it fails to identify you, it will add that data to its cache. I personally scanned my face normally the first time and on the second scan did it at roughly a 45 degree angle so I could lean over my phone to view notifications. As I've adjusted to Face ID, it has gotten faster and faster at scanning my face and it's not something you need to wait on to open your phone. By the time you swipe up on your phone, it's unlocked and ready to go (I seriously forget I have a password). I also really enjoy the ability to utilize Face ID for my password for other logins and the ability to open up an app directly from the lock screen without having to then enter my fingerprint/passcode. It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gather's and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business (hello Google & Facebook). The price: There seems to be this running idea that a Rs.89,000 phone is a crazy purchase, but I would have to disagree. Why? My logic is as followed: Phones are one of the most used devices (easily mine) so for starters, I would like a nice one. If I didn't buy the device in full, I would have been paying roughly Rs. 10,000 a month on EMI for 9 months. The base model is a 64GB iPhone loaded with the best Apple has to offer. A 128GB 6S at launch was Rs.70,000. Yes, there's a price difference, but my point is that it's not as gigantic as it may seem. I personally would advocate a 64GB version and be utilizing cloud storage if you need more space, but do note, this is Apple's flagship and there are cheaper iPhone's out there. What I love: - The screen looks amazing. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep with black wallpapers flowing aimlessly into the phone (to the point you cannot see the notch in the screen if the wallpaper is black). - The Notch! Yes, the notch. Some people seem to hate it, I think it's iconic and makes the iPhone X stand alone in oled sphere. It fades into the user experience and I have not had any issues with it. - The screen size. I have always wanted a plus, but I always felt like it was too big for my hands. That I would drop the phone and there it goes. The X remedies this for me and I get to use a larger screen in nearly the same form factor as my 6S. The screen truly looks amazing and if you haven't seen one, check one out at a local store. - I'm not sure how much of this is just because my 6S was a few years old, but the taptic engine in the X is amazing. As in, when the phone vibrates, I can easily identify what it is through the vibration and the vibration itself feels smooth. - Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. - The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. - The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. - The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. What I don't: Honestly, I do not have a genuine complaint at this point. The only complaint that comes to mind revolves around the lack of optimization I have faced in some apps, but that is a developer problem and even then, developers have optimized a majority of their apps and my issues have been few and far between.",02 May 2018,"From a 6S to an X - A wonderful, luxury, phone.",5.0 ,Vibhor

"The iPhone X is an innovative device with a fantastic camera and beautiful display, but other phones are tougher and can operate longer on a charge. Those are among the conclusions we’ve reached after completing testing on Apple’s new flagship model, which starts at $1,000 for the 64-gigabyte version. Overall, the iPhone X—as in 10, not the letter that follows W—easily made Consumer Reports’ recommended list and broke into the extremely tight list of top 10 rated phones, where all the devices are separated by only two points on our 100-point scale. It was edged out by Apple’s less-expensive iPhone 8, starting at $700, and 8 Plus, starting at $800, which both proved hardier in a test designed to reproduce the drops and fumbles that can cause cracked screens and other damage. “If not for the damage in that durability test, the iPhone X would have come in ahead of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,” says Richard Fisco, head of smartphone testing at CR. Given how close the scores of all the phones in our top 10 are, it’s not really a question of which phone is best but which is the best fit for you. If you’re choosing among the new crop of iPhones, one of the most obvious differences is the lack of a Home button on the iPhone X and the advent of Face ID for unlocking the phone (more on that below). Additionally, the iPhone X has the biggest screen of the three—5.8 inches, measured diagonally, compared with 5.5 inches for the iPhone 8 Plus and 4.7 inches for the 8. But that expansive display comes in a tight package: The iPhone X is just a smidge taller than the iPhone 8 at 5.6 inches, and more than a half-inch shorter than the iPhone 8 Plus. Here’s a closer look at our test results and how the iPhone X compares with other top-rated phones on the market. The iPhone X's Strengths Beautiful Display The iPhone X features Apple’s first OLED phone screen. The technology, already used by smartphone manufacturers such as LG and Samsung and found in some high-end TVs, can produce very deep black tones and unlimited viewing angles. (That means the image doesn’t noticeably degrade when you view the screen from the side.) Our testers gave the phone’s display excellent marks, pointing to its overall brightness and vibrant colors, along with the deep black levels. We think that Apple shoppers who put the iPhone X side by side with the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will notice a significant difference, although these phones have very good screens as well. Outstanding Cameras The rear camera on the iPhone X is among the best we’ve ever seen. In fact, if you combine the performance scores for stills and video, this is the highest-rated smartphone camera Consumer Reports has tested. Like the 7 Plus and 8 Plus, the iPhone X has a second, 2X zoom camera on the back of the phone. But unlike those other iPhones, both of the iPhone X’s backside cameras have optical image stabilization, which steadies the lenses to offset the effects of shaky hands. (The 7 Plus and 8 Plus have that feature on only one camera lens.) This setup produced impressive results when testers compared photos using the zoom to those shot using the zoom lenses of earlier iPhone Plus models. Stills taken with the iPhone X were sharp, with excellent color reproduction, and video was very sharp as well. Convenient Face ID Much has been made of Apple’s decision to do away with the Home button on the iPhone X. That opened up screen real estate, but when the Home button disappeared, the embedded fingerprint sensor went with it, and Apple now relies upon a new biometric feature for authenticating users. Called Face ID, the technology maps your features and lets you unlock the phone simply by taking a look at the screen. (You can also type in a PIN.) We found the setup and unlocking process to be both quick and easy. The technology worked when we held the phone at all but the most severe angles and did not falter when used by testers with a wide range of skin tones, even when they put on reading glasses. You need to look directly at the screen to prompt it to unlock, making it less likely that you’ll unlock the device inadvertently. The removal of the Home button requires you to learn a series of new swipe and button commands to operate the phone. This takes a little getting used to. But our testers picked up on the new gestures quickly and were satisfied with the phone’s overall usability. The iPhone X's Shortcomings Broken Glass In our initial drop test, the iPhone X performed just fine. It survived four falls onto a concrete surface from a height of 5 feet. For that quick test, we used our custom-designed Drop Tower and let the phone fall on its front, back, and two different corners. However, iPhone X phones didn’t fare nearly as well when subjected to a more intensive lab test in a tumbling machine. The tumbler is a rotating chamber that repeatedly drops a phone from a height of about 2.5 feet. The phones are checked for damage after 50 drops and then again after 100. The goal of all that repetition is to expose the phone to impacts from a wide variety of angles. We tumbled three samples of the iPhone X. The first was fine after 50 drops, but the glass on the back was significantly cracked after 100. The other two phones ended up with malfunctioning displays after 50 drops. Though the front glass didn’t crack, several bright green bars stretched across the screens from top to bottom. The iPhone X isn’t the first phone to fail our tumble test. For example, our testers also reported broken displays and back panels when they tumbled Samsung’s nearly all-glass Galaxy S8 and S8+ phones. In light of those results, we recommend that you protect any of these phones in a case. Responding to our findings, Apple affirmed the iPhone X's durability based on the company's ""rigorous real world testing"" and said that the phone ""is made from the most durable glass ever in a smartphone."" Durability is something to think about if you’re considering a purchase of the iPhone X. The phone isn’t just expensive to buy; it’s also unusually pricey to repair. For example, the Apple Store will charge you $279 to fix the display and $549 to fix any other part of the phone, including its glass back. (This could make it worthwhile for some consumers to shell out for AppleCare+ coverage, which costs $199.) Tumble tests don’t get a lot of weight when we calculate a phone’s Overall Score. However, these results combined with the iPhone X’s comparatively low battery-life showing (see below) did knock the phone down a few spots in our rankings, says Fisco, who leads CR’s phone testing program. On the flip side, the iPhone X aced our water-resistance testing, surviving for 30 minutes at a depth of about 3 feet, just as Apple promises in its specs. The phone was examined right afterward, as well as one, two, and three days later, and continued to work. This is consistent with the results for other recent Apple phones, including the 7- and 8-series iPhones, which also did well in our water-immersion tests. Short Battery Life The iPhone X’s battery life hurt the phone’s Overall Score in Consumer Reports testing. To find out exactly how long a phone’s battery can go, Consumer Reports uses a robotic finger programmed to put the phone through a range of tasks designed to simulate a consumer’s average day. The robot browses the internet, takes pictures, uses GPS navigation, and, of course, makes phone calls. We run all smartphone battery tests with the display set to 100 percent brightness. If you use any phone’s auto, or adaptive, brightness, the battery should last longer. In our testing, the iPhone X’s battery lasted 19.5 hours. That’s just ahead of the 19 hours logged by the iPhone 8 and the considerably smaller iPhone SE but below the 21 hours recorded by the 8 Plus—and it’s far less than the 26 hours that Samsung’s S8 and S8+ delivered. (Some other smartphones in our ratings run even longer on a charge.) While for many people 19.5 hours is enough to get them through the day, it’s still shorter than the majority of the 38 smartphones we recommend. According to Apple, the iPhone X’s A11 Bionic chip is designed to manage the device’s power supply intelligently, balancing the demands for speed and energy in a way that permits you to complete the tasks you perform most often—think texting or web browsing—with optimal efficiency. When you combine that with the model’s custom battery design, the company says, the iPhone X should last “up to 2 hours longer between charges than the iPhone 7.” In our tests, the iPhone 7’s battery lasted 18.5 hours. Which iPhone to Buy? If you’re looking for a new iPhone, is the X worth the $1,000 and up that Apple is charging? That depends on your preferences. A lot of people would argue that the iPhone X represents the future of smartphones. It boasts the best overall camera results in CR's testing and one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a phone. And while you don’t get the familiar Home button, you pick up a decent amount of screen space in a phone that’s significantly smaller than the 7 Plus and 8 Plus. It’s easier to hold and use, not to mention lighter to carry. And Face ID works very effectively. The phone seems to unlock as soon as you pick it up and even think about making a call. Its gesture system takes some getting used to, but it’s not overly cumbersome or difficult to use. Taken as a complete package, this phone ranked a bit lower than Samsung’s S8, S8+, and Note8, mainly because of their superior battery life. But many longtime iPhone users aren’t interested in switching to Android, so the real question for them is whether to save a few bucks—or, actually, a couple hundred—and go with an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus instead. These iPhones are more resistant to breaking, and they have the familiar Home button, which means you don’t have to spend time learning a new system of swipes and button clicks. Because all these phones are top performers, the choice is ultimately a matter of personal priorities. Here’s another idea: If you want to save even more money, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus remain viable options. They look pretty much the same as the 8 and 8 Plus and offer many of the same features. And they’ll cost you just $550 and $670, respectively. If you’re still on the fence, this is one of those times where it pays to try before you buy. Play with all of these phones in the store, paying attention to how much the gorgeous iPhone X display means to you and how you feel about learning new gestures—and then considering how often you’ve dropped previous gadgets on the sidewalk.",07 Dec 2017,Apple shoppers face a tough choice between this phone and the iPhone 8,5.0 ,HARSH SHARMA

"This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month. @ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone. This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money. BUILT QUALITY : -------------------- # iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible to easy damages. # iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR. # Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed. # To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice. DISPLAY : ----------- # iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio. # Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P # According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : ----------------------------- # I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8. # If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily. # I found X to be better value for money in this segment. BATTERY PERFORMANCE : ------------------------------ # All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging. # XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time. *XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours. # With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours. # Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance. CAMERA : ----------- # In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera. * Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent. # XS sometimes does better over X, but not always. # Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly. # Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion. PRICE (64GB) : --------------- 8 - Rs.55K X - Rs.75K XR - Rs.77k XS - Rs.99K # Here certainly 8 is winner :P P.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy. VERDICT : ----------- After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice. If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS. To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter. If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.

Took photos, shoot video's and everything is fine The fourth day I realised the setback with the phone, the screen started having hairline scratches and thats where I realised what apple said about the toughest glass ever in smartphone statement is not correct. I was so upset to see a 75k phone screen scratches in a week. Went to iPhone store and to my surprise they say its a common complaint and suggested to put a screen guard. What a stupid thing from Apple to sell such and expensive and so poor quality screen. My 15K Motorola phone ever after an year of usage had not a single scratch.

When I asked if the back panel of iPhone X is steel or glass, he was stammering, and only after looking realized that the back is glass panel. Underqualified and unprofessional inspection, taking pictures of the phone which was not even focused, so basically taking a blurry photo on an inspection, speaks volume about his capabilities.

This is what i have experienced within use of one week: 1. The screen freezes and the phone becomes unresponsive at times. 2. The fast charger doesnt work it takes upto 3-4 hours for complete charge. 3. Cannot take calls as the phone freezes. 4. While on call voice disappears from the earpiece have to use the loud speaker to talk.,25 Oct 2018,Cons of iphone x,2.0 ,Karan
"I bought Iphone X in August and while i was using it , it felt down from the chair . The Screen got Cracked in the top of the mobile . When i took it service center in Chennai , they asked for 27000 INR for repair . The same i took it another Authorised Premium service Center They have asked for 30000 INR . Each service center is quoting different pricing for the same Iphone Screen . There is no uniform pricing for the repair services. So, never trust Apple products and buy . Instead you can buy better brands for lot more cheaper and better quality & Service back up . I Stopped using Apple products after their irregular and high level of arrogance attidtude of Service center . They behave like as if they come from USA . DONT BUY APPLE ... THERE ARE MANY ORANGES IN THE MARKET .",01 Apr 2019,Screen Crack in 6 Months & Very Expensive for replacement of Screen,2.0 ,Rahumathullah
"The iPhone X was Apple's long due overhaul of the whole iPhone lineup which promised to completely rebuild the foundation of iPhone's design language. Boy, did they deliver! The iPhone X is an excellent smartphone with little to no cons, but isn't that to be expected when we're paying a whopping Rs 74,000 for last year's phone. Let's get into the details. Hardware The iPhone X still looks and feels as premium as a smartphone could possibly feel. The build of the phone is very, very fine tuned with proper attention to detail. The buttons are responsive and provide a satisfying tactile feedback. And since the iPhone XS and XS Max have the same design essentially, the iPhone X is still the latest and most premium iPhone design in the market today. When you hold the iPhone X in your hand, the stainless steel frame and glass front and back combine to give you a feeling of luxury. It is a bit slippery, but a joy to use case free. Software Like every other iPhone, iPhone X runs iOS 12 now and as expected it is still blazing fast with no stutters, lags or app crashes experienced. If you're someone who likes to tinker their devices, iOS can get pretty boring pretty fast because the customisation options are pretty much non-existent. However, the advantage to this close walled approach of Apple is that the software experience is extremely polished and refined. The quality of third party applications is also significantly better than Android. The gesture based navigation system is something that takes getting used to, especially if you're coming from a home button iPhone, but you get used to it in a couple of hours. As with all iPhones, you can expect regular software updates for at least the next 3 years and maybe even more. If you're okay with the lack of customisability on iOS, there is practically nothing to dislike about this software experience. Display Oh my, what a gorgeous panel. Apple has used, for the first time, an AMOLED Samsung panel on the iPhone X. It is gorgeous and a huge step up compared to previous iPhones with LCD screens. Rich and bright colours, crisp text and sharp details. Absolute joy to use this display. Speakers Again, excellent speakers. One earpiece and one bottom speaker unit. They give off a decent audio experience with clear vocals and average treble. The tweeter is surprisingly good but you can not expect a lot of bass on such a small unit. All in all, great speakers. Camera Typical iPhone camera experience here. Takes amazing pictures with good detail but natural and a bit dull colours. Click away to your heart's content and then later edit them with filters to get the extra pop if you're into that sort of thing. I'm a huge fan of the iPhone video camera. It simply bests any other smartphone when it comes to video recording. The image is stable and smooth when you turn on the 4K 60fps setting. The portrait modes are okay on both the front and rear facing cameras. Not nearly as perfect as the experience on the Google Pixel. Still beats the rest of the crowd though. Conclusion Now you may ask, what is the con here? It's the price. At Rs 74-75,000 the iPhone X is crazy expensive for a smartphone that came out last year. The iPhone XR at Rs 54,000 further makes the iPhone X a hard recommend. My advice would be to get a XR in most cases, but if you have to have the better design and display without spending Rs 90,000 for the XS, get the iPhone X. Still a stellar device which comes as close to perfection as any smartphone can.",10 Apr 2019,iPhone X,4.0 ,Rohan Bhateja

"Well, this phone should be advertised for either elderly or kids. Relatively No practical use for people on move in day to day life. I have a pixel and this.

If you were using android, forget your whatsapp chat history so far.

I am using iPhone more than 4 years and ome thing I must say Apple after sale service is one of the best.I have never faced any problem so far. I have never purchased iPhome online because fear of clone phones. So if any body facing any issue with iPhone X then you should not worry. Go to any Apple service center and you will get the best service.If the problem can't be solved then they will replace the phone with a brand new phone but it must be in warranty.,11 Dec 2018,Best and secure Phone by Apple.,5.0 ,Saroj Kumar Pradhan

"Extremely disappointed with Iphone X ! It's been 14 days since I bought the phone and already I am unable to hear anything over regular voice calls on the phone! After spending so much I am unable to use the phone for its basic feature.....making calls!! After speaking with Apple customer care for over 2 hours I am yet to receive a solution which may take 2-3 days! But come on!!! It's the basic function of a phone! My worst purchase ever! Also if you still have to waste your money on this ""premium product"" then most definitely don't buy online through Amazon cause they provide zero support. They have a 10day return policy and your phone stops working on 14th day and you are abandoned and left on your own to deal with apple. Who btw don't replace your phone and instead do some ""investigation"" and take their own sweet time. And did I mention the problem is the basic feature of any phone!!!!.... Unable to hear anything on calls!!!! And it doesn't matter what your review or feedback or your experience is .. both Apple and Amazon care more about their ""profit-making policies"" rather than the customer's experience or problems. You can rest assured that your issues and feedback is just background noise to them. What's worse is that this was my gift to my mum. And it turned out to be an utter flop.

"Apple iPhone X (Silver, 64GB) Apple is always known for their build quality and flawless software and the iPhone X is the epitome of their innovation. Have been using it for three weeks now and can safely say that this the best phone currently available in the market, with the Pixel XL a distant second. Pros: - the end to end retina display is absolutely amazing. Apple TrueTone display adjusts better than Android phones with changes in ambient light - software: iOS 11.2.5 is very user friendly and intuitive. My phone hasnt ever lagged or stuttered so far. - pretty good battery backup (easily lasting for an entire day on normal usage) - FaceID is a whole new ball game and apple wins it hands down. It is extremely accurate and easy to use and unlocks your phone as fast as fingerprint and even works in the dark. It is also secure as it checks if you are looking at the phone before performing a FaceID action. This is by far the best feature I felt on iPhone X and is a class apart from android phones. - the camera is really good in daylight and has a host of new features which includes portrait mode. Cons: - I personally dont like the notch at the top and makes the display look a little ugly. - Fast charger is not provided in the box. The charger provided takes very long (~1 hr 45 min) to charge the phone. - Earphones provided are not of the best quality. - Front camera is pretty average and doesnt take exceptional pictures under dim lighting conditions. That said, iPhone X is overpriced and is definitely not value for money. But if you are willing to shell off money to get the best phone in the market then this is what you should buy.",10 Feb 2018,The best phone currently available in the market,5.0 ,Avishek De

It's not the seller but the build quality for sure. My phone got stuck after the first restart. It kept showing a black screen and the apple logo, again & again. It's a known issue but very few people got this. I even tried all of the mentioned fixes but none worked. Had to submit the device to Apple service center and now there is a waiting period of at least 10 days, till I get a new device or they fix this one. Very disheartening for such an expensive device.

"I was an android user since 2011. I always kept iPhone away while buying a new phone. My primary concern while selecting a smartphone is the Camera. And my previous Xperia and Samsung flagships served well in that purpose. This time I have short listed Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone X. Since the price difference between both of them are small and the lags on my last android phones compelled me to buy iPhone X. I have previously used iPhone 5S and 6 Plus for a short period. Both were 16gb and I returned to Android phones due to limited sharing options and lack of extra storage. Speaking of iPhone X, it is beautiful, heavy weighted, elegant by looks. The performance is very fast, the camera is just awesome. There is ton of iPhone X reviews on YouTube/internet so I am not going to review it here.I am just sharing some pros and cons according to my usage Protection Tips :- Case :- I brought a SPIGEN Neon Ultra Hybrid Crystal case as that provides solid drop protection as well as has silver lining that matchs well with silver color of my phone Screen Protector :- Here i brought MTT it has all the usual features some people may also go for the full body protection that even protects the top notch but that might add bulk but hey that's my opinion . Pros: :- Super fast :- Elegant & beautiful design. :- Large screen of 5.8 inch. :- Good battery backup. Lasts full day on heavy usage. :- Facial Recognition (Face ID) :- Great photos both day light and low light. :- Quad LED flash :- Very good portrait photos. (Stage light is a hit or miss all other mods work beautifully) :- 10X optical zoom using Dual 12mp cameras. :- Great quality, loud sound. :- Fastest Processor A11 Bionic :- 7mp front camera. :- Awesome 240FPS slow-motion videos in 1080p :- Great video quality :- Stainless steel body :- Wireless charging. :- Not much heating. :- Highest Display Brightness of 574 nits ( Samsung Galaxy note 8 has 408 nits) :- Best in class OLED as said by ""Display Mate"" :- The new swipes gestures are really intuitive , they have a natural and simple flow to them :- Best video recording , as for still photos it falls just behind google Pixel 2 ( not much ) :- First Bezel less design iPhone Cons: :- Very high price when compared to other countries :- Very large & heavy. It is very difficult to hold for long time. Hands get hurts. :- Large Screen make one handed operation difficult. :- Apple's new image & video format is not supported by most devices. :- No complete file manager. :- No dedicated headphone jack. We should keep a Bluetooth headphone to use while charging. :- Limited sharing functionality. :- Un grouped notifications are annoying. :- IOS 11 is buggy and there is an update each weak. :- No fast charging adapter (We can charge using fast charging power bank or other phones adapter though) :- Same Design as android abet the notch :- The back glass gonna break easily. :- We have to use a thick case to protect the camera due to camera bump. :- The stainless steel body is prone to a lot of scratches :- battery percentage not shown up have to scroll down to see it hope IOS update will provide option I have attached some photos taken using my iPhone X.

"The flagship phone from Apple is undoubtedly a marvel though the price tag was a big deterrent for me. Before finalizing, I compared it with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 - on almost all accounts I found iPhone X definitely more superior. My assessment after using it for 2 weeks is as follows: Pros 1. The Face ID is a first - a technological leap. It works most of the time except when the room is completely dark. 2. Speakers - This caught my attention immediately, the speakers on the bottom of the phone simply rock. 3. Screen - Is a little annoying initially but then Apple had to embed the facial recognition technology somewhere, you can live with it especially after you notice the brightness of the screen along with crystal clear display 4. Battery - Fairly decent, easily lasts a day with heavy usage of checking mails, surfing the net and video streaming. 5. Camera: The images are very impressive though Apple still has massive competition from Samsung here. 5. Looks - While there is nothing extraordinary, it does have a premium feel look and is heavy as compared to the earlier iPhone. A backcover ruins the feel of the phone but then it saves from potential damage it just in case if slips from your hand and falls on a hard/rough surface. Cons 1. The price but then everyone's buying without complaining so one can't do much. If you can afford it, close your eyes and buy it - simply worth it. Also for people who can't tolerate bloatware and restricted app privacy settings in Android, this phone has it all....",02 Jan 2018,I compared it with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and Google Pixel 2 - on almost all accounts I found iPhone X definitely more superior.

The iPhone X – or iPhone 10 – is a hugely important device for Apple. Not only does its release coincide with the 10th anniversary of arguably the most important tech product of the past decade, but it’s the first iPhone in four years to undergo a major redesign. It’s also the best iPhone I’ve ever used – but it comes at a cost. A pretty hefty one. The iPhone X saw a big change to the long-established iPhone formula, and currently, it’s difficult to say if it’s been a complete success.

"I am writing this review after using the phone for more than 3 weeks now... was using Apple earlier too so of course it felt like home.. I upgraded from. 6s 64 gig to iPhone X and must say it was a much needed switch.. This phone is undoubtedly the best in market as far as looks and performance goes.. the so called notch doesn’t at all come in the way and the OLED screen is just too perfect.. I don’t really think an iPhone needs a review, it’s as simple as use it to believe it! The only thing I didn’t like is that the price reduced by 4.5k during new year immediately after I purchased, but that’s a gamble one has to play! I won’t even say it’s overpriced as it’s obvious that iPhone is an iPhone. It has excellent resale value and if at all I want to sell it after 2 years I think I can get a good value.. of course you need to protect your phone with a good case.. I like to keep my phone as good as New always! :-) Go for it... if you have the budget or can pay EMI .. iphones do not really need a review!",18 Jan 2018,It’s really a beast and am loving it!,5.0 ,Mehul Vyas

The revolutionary iPhone X is among the top releases of the year. It has been just about three months since the phone has been released and the demand is still the same.

"Well, if you bought it you know it. And such phones at this cost one does not buy reading reviews over such sites. My experience has been superb. Face ID works like a magic. Absence of Home Button does not impede working at all. I will soon try wireless charging. The screen is elegant. I agree the great notch on the top robs the looks a little bit. I was able to restore backup from my old iPhone 6s quite easily from iTunes on Mac Book pro. The only catch is that the pre-installed iOS needs an upgrade before the import.",17 Dec 2017,Excellent Phone,5.0 ,NinjaS

"The X might have the thinnest screen bezels of any iPhone, but it could only get there by ditching the physical home button. That also meant getting rid of TouchID fingerprint scanning, so instead we get FaceID facial recognition. It takes two cameras (one regular, one IR) an IR dot emitter and separate IR flood illuminator to accurately scan and recognise your face in less than half a second, and all that tech takes up space. The way it bulges out into the display is certainly unique. It’s a bit like Marmite - you either love the distinctive look, or you hate the way it intrudes on your screen space. After a week with the phone, I’m in the former camp - although the effect it has on software is another matter. Open an app that hasn’t been updated yet and you’ll get massive black borders at the top and bottom of the screen, or left and right when you’re in landscape. The notch is unmissable in this mode when you open Safari, with certain web pages looking downright ugly. Apps that use Apple’s autolayout fill the screen, but not always how you’d expect - sometimes blocking out the battery indicator or losing UI elements offscreen. Even apps that have been updated can look a little funky. The fact that big names like Spotify didn’t have updated apps ready to go on launch day is a bit of a joke. But anyway, back to the screen itself. It’s a 5.8in panel, technically making it larger than the iPhone 8 Plus, but the 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it’s more like an iPhone 8 stretched vertically. Add in the notch and that’s quite a lot of dead space in certain apps and games. Honestly, though? It’s difficult to mind that much - the screen is absolutely phenomenal. That’s mainly down to the switch from LCD to OLED, giving the X the impeccable contrast and deep, inky blacks that have been impressing us on Samsung’s Galaxy phones for years. Resolution has leapt up to 2436x1125, a big change from the iPhone 8 Plus and its 1080p panel. Pentile panel tech might not resolve as much detail as an RGB LCD screen, but some clever anti-aliasing on Apple’s part means it’s difficult to spot any lack of detail. OLED panels can end up so looking ridiculously vibrant you’ll want to wear sunglasses whenever you look at them, but Apple has been pretty restrained here: photos and videos on the X still pop with colour, but they stay on the right side of realistic. TrueTone colour calibration helps here, automatically tweaking the colour temperature to match the ambient light around you. It’s a subtle effect, but you’ll notice the difference when you flick it on and off in the settings screen. It gets impressively bright for an OLED panel, too. I had no problem reading the screen outdoors on a sunny day. That brightness comes in handy for HDR video - the X supports both HDR10 and Dolby Vision. Netflix is already updated, and works great on a good connection, with a great range of colour and more depth to dark scenes. For all the pitchforks and torches banging on Google’s door over the Pixel 2 XL’s off-angle colour shift, the iPhone X isn’t immune from the effects either. With no home button, the X makes you rethink how to use your iPhone. And it all starts with FaceID. Instead of tapping the fingerprint sensor, you now raise the phone, tap anywhere onscreen or press the side button to wake it, then swipe up from the bottom of the display to get past the lock screen. Normally, in the time you’ve done all that, FaceID has fired out thousands of tiny infra red dots, scanned them with an IR camera, and mapped your face. All your contours, curves, bumps and ridges make for a unique ID that’s even more difficult to fool than a fingerprint sensor. As you’ve only got one face (I hope), you don’t have to consider which hand you’ll be picking up the phone with, or to hold it in a certain way so your finger lines up with a physical button - handy if you found the iPhone 8 just a little bit too small, or the Plus that little bit too big. When FaceID works, it works brilliantly, taking less than half a second to recognise you and unlock the phone. Over time, it’ll get better at recognising you, tracking things like hair and beard growth so as not to get confused. Go for a shave and buzzcut and you might need to retrain it, though. It worked through sunglasses, while I was wearing chunky headphones, and with a hoodie covering my hair, but leaning my hand on my chin could sometimes defeat it. Lying in bed, I would often hold the phone too close to get a match, and it’s harder to unlock while sat on your desk than the old TouchID system. It might not be 100% accurate, but it’s still better than any other face scanner we’ve tried on a phone, including the ones found on some Samsungs. When it does fail, you’ve got to tap in a passcode - just like you would with TouchID. It’s not exactly elegant, but it’s rare enough not to be annoying - unless you’re stood at a London Underground ticket barrier, with a queue of people behind you. Double-tapping the side button to invoke Apple Pay and waiting for a face match feels a little bit slower than the old TouchID system, but maybe that’ll change once it becomes second nature. All these face-scanning shenanigans might sound serious, but there’s a lighter side to it all too. Fire up iMessage and you can play with Animoji: animated emoji characters that you can move with your face. By motion-tracking your facial features, the phone can animate your eyes and expressions perfectly, recording your voice in sync for sending as messages to your mates. It’s purely for fun, and all but guaranteed to annoy your non-iPhone X equipped mates, but undeniably cute at the same time. While the notch might seem like a big deal, it totally disappears once you’ve spent a few hours with the phone. With most day-to-day tasks, you won’t really notice it, especially when using the iPhone X in portrait mode. What you will notice over time is how the entire iOS UI has been redesigned around it. Until now, iPhone models have had an ever-present (unless you are in the full-screen mode) bar that’s been used to display all kinds of important information from the time, to signal strength, and to even indicate if some app is using your location information. With the iPhone X’s notch, there’s very little space for all this information - the left side is taken up entirely by the clock, while the right only has room for the signal strength indicator, 3G/ 4G/ Wi-Fi indicator, and the battery icon. You no longer see things like the name of the network, which might not seem like a big loss, but there are two other compromises that will potentially be more upsetting for most users. The battery percentage and Bluetooth connection status are now only visible only if you swipe down from the right of the notch, and there’s no way to have them always visible. If you use Bluetooth devices like AirPods, speakers, or in-car units, you can no longer tell at a glance if your phone is connected. The notch will bother you in full-screen games and videos, or if you use the your phone in landscape mode a lot. By default, the aspect ratio of the iPhone X’s display means that most videos will play with thick enough black bands on the left and right that the notch will blend in without any problems. However, if you choose to zoom in - by using pinch-to-zoom in the YouTube app for example - you bring the notch into play, even as the video gets cropped like on any other device. We regularly watched videos zoomed-in and it didn’t bother us one bit, but your mileage may vary. On the other hand, we did like some of the changes that the notch’s presence has resulted in. One of our favourite iOS features is the ability to scroll to the top of any list or page by tapping the bar at top. However, if some app is using your location in the background, or if some device is connected to the hotspot on your phone, this functionality breaks as tapping on the bar then takes you to the app using your location in the background, or the Hotspot settings, as the case may be. With the iPhone X, the location/ hotspot alerts are restricted to the left “ear”, which means you can still tap the notch or the right ear to scroll to the top of any list - that’s right, the notch does recognise your taps. We’ve spent considerable time talking about the notch, but if you are wondering what exactly it is, this little section is for you. With the iPhone X doing away with the Home button - and with it the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Apple needed a new way for us to quickly and securely log in to our devices and authorise payments. The solution is Face ID, and the notch contains the front camera and 3D sensing sensors that make this technology possible. The three main components here are the infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector. The latter projects “more than 30,000 invisible dots” onto your face to build a 3D map that can be used to identify you. The flood illuminator makes it possible to do that in the dark by emitting invisible infrared light, and the infrared camera reads the dot pattern. The infrared image is sent to the Secure Enclave in the A11 Bionic chip - a special area that’s used to store biometric data on the chip that powers the iPhone X - to confirm a match. Like with Touch ID, Apple says no biometric data actually leaves the device at any point, which means that your privacy is assured. The day the iPhone X was announced - and well before we had spent any meaningful time with it - we said that Face ID felt like a compromise, that it could never be as fast as Touch ID, and that Apple would go back to using fingerprint scanners as soon as it could figure out how to embed them into the glass fronts of its phones . A couple of months into having used the iPhone X, it’s safe to say that while Face ID might not have the raw speed of Touch ID, a move away from Face ID won’t be because of any significant drawbacks in the technology. It works seamlessly on most occasions, and more reliably than we’d imagined it would going into our review. It’s almost like having any no passcode or security feature on your device. That might not be a change for many people - despite manufacturers’ warnings during the setup process, we find an uncomfortably large number of people continue to use their smartphones without a passcode - but for everyone else, Face ID reduces the extra step of unlocking your phone before you can use it.Granted, most of us had become accustomed to using fingerprints to the point that it never felt like an “additional step”, but now, at most times, you can just pick up your iPhone X and trust that Face ID is just authenticating you in the background. For all practical purposes, this feels like using a phone without a passcode. This is especially great when you are interacting with notifications. Before the iPhone X, tapping on a notification - say, to read an email - on a locked device meant using Touch ID or needing to enter passcode to unlock before you could proceed. With Face ID, the additional step is removed, and you can now interact with notifications as originally intended The ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed Face ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t close enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of luck. Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too. iPhone X – Screen The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR. OLEDs offer better contrast, true blacks and a more colourful picture, but they’re not always perfect. The LG panels used by Google in the Pixel 2 XL have come in for plenty of criticism for poor viewing angles and an odd blue tinge. Even the excellent screen on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is prone to suffering poor viewing angles. Apple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own Galaxy S8 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn’t quite so intense. At last...... The Good A great blend of handheld comfort and a big, gorgeous OLED screen. Rear telephoto camera outshoots the 8 Plus in low light, and the front camera snaps impressive portrait selfies. Face ID generally works fine. The Bad New interface and no home button mean major adjustments, and key features such as the Control Center are harder to reach and use. It’ll take time for most apps to be optimized for notched screen. The phone is hella expensive, and the all-glass design means a case and an insurance plan are musts. Shorter battery life than iPhone Plus models. The Bottom Line iPhone X is an overdue and winning evolution of the iPhone, but you’ll need to leave your comfort zone to make a jump into the face-recognizing future.

"It's important to note here that your privacy is well, yours. No one has access to the data Face ID gathers and it is truly yours. Apple has a good track record on keeping your data private as they are not in the data business # New screen (5.8” OLED is the most vibrant and clear screen ever produced by Apple) # Apple has removed the touch ID sensor and bezel around the old iPhone screen which means the iPhone X has a noticeably smaller footprint while maintaining a larger screen size than the iPhone 7/8 Plus. # Similar to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus the iPhone X uses true tone technology to mimic the lighting conditions around it and adjust the white balance accordingly. # The notch cut out of the top of the screen is where Apple has included the face recognition sensors, front camera, and a host of other sensors. # Force touch is also fantastic and the haptic feedback on everything from a like on twitter to moving apps around is wonderful. Makes the screen feel more three-dimensional in a way. # The camera takes wonderful pictures. I have taken a few pictures in portrait mode and some pictures genuinely look like they were taken with a DSLR camera. # The speakers are louder than I expected and sound very clear. Great for impromptu music listening. # The phone is a little heavy, but it is definitely comfortable to hold. It feels like a luxury device and has a certain weight to it. # I have tested this flawlessly with glasses, a hat, and even in the dark. It is as simple as looking at your phone and swiping up from the bottom. # This super powerful new camera also enables the animoji features which maps your facial expressions to create a talking emoji. This is a fun feature but more a novelty than anything. # This same true-depth camera makes the iPhone X the ultimate phone for taking selfies. The new portrait mode allows the user blur the background, or even cut yourself out entirely and place yourself on a black background. # The rear camera boasts a dual 12MP sensor array with improved aperture and wide angle lens with image stabilization. The increased aperture from 2.8 to 2.4 allows for better images in low light conditions. # Video capabilities have also approved as well to include 60p 4k video recording delivering clear, fluid images. # Increased RAM size to 3GB and new Bionic Chip makes the iPhone X one of the most powerful smartphones are the market # Updated design features glass back and sides which make the phone beautiful looking. A very welcome change in the normal design. # Battery life: The iPhone X boasts the largest battery in Apple history with a 2716 mAh battery which is a bit larger than the new iPhone 8 Plus. A full charge from 0-100% takes about 2 hours and 10 minutes in my testing. # In addition, wireless charging has finally been added to the new iPhone X, and 8 series phones. I have not tested this out but am excited to give it a try (Wireless charging pad is not included with the phone).

"Well it’s difficult to review this IPhone, Firstly it’s depends which your previous phone was, say you had the 7 plus or any plus iPhone the first thing which will hit you hard is the screen it’s smaller and if you come from 6,7 or earlier iPhone you will just love it. Face ID works most times only you need to get adjusted, the distance from hand to face must be a bit close. There are so small bits which you will love like when you get a notification SMS or what’s app message it will not show you the content only when u look at it you can see the content. Now you can wake up the phone with just a touch, Battery life lasts whole day for me Screen is amazing wish it was bigger To power off your phone you need to hold volume and the power key You will not miss the Touch ID after few days of use the swipe up works like a charm Now to close apps you need to swipe up and press and hold any app and then close Siri also has improved, now hey Siri works while charging.

"Do not buy this phone. Its an extremely over-hyped & overpriced phone. Going with the apple-hype I pre-ordered this phone elsewhere, used it for 2 weeks extensively & sold it b4 its too late to take a fresh breath of air. Keypoints as below: . Very fragile back, backglass shatters even from 5 feet drop and then it costs above Rs 35000. . Face id is not convenient at all.Its not secure as well as per latest data. . If front glass breaks, it makes the face id unusable. And then pay a bomb to replace the front panel. . iOS is not optimised for this iPhone X yet resulting in buggy, sluggish performances, better wait for next gen iPhone X in 2018. . US price is around 67000 INR including tax and Indian price is Rs 89000 for the 64 gb model and similar price difference for the 256 gb model as well. .Notch kills the ""show"" while doing anything on the screen. .Stainless steel rim is gimmicky and is highly prone to scratches even after protective cases worn. .Crackling sounds-that can be heard when using the iPhone X speakerphone at high volumes. If you are a die hard fan of Apple iPhones, then get the iPhone 8 Plus, you will less regret. Do not allow Apple to make fool out of Indian consumers. #Just because I am not a ""verified buyer"" here, amazon does not stop me from speaking and writing truth#. ........... Update (23/01/2018): Though the hype worked for Apple initially, due to the phone itself being inferior, the sales of iPhone X has declined all over the world recently.Also, as per many reliable sources(CNET, MASHABLE, BGR etc.,just Google it out), Apple will be discontinuing the production of this first gen iPhone X in 2018 itself to keep its ""brand value"" once the next gen comes up.",30 Nov 2017,"Overpriced, over-hyped phone.",2.0 ,H.K.

"Face reader working good, not fine. Phone call is working only when I am talking through loudspeaker and headphone, normally no sound( I guess I am missing something on settings). Worst Battery.

"Though I am a OnePlus fan, but I use apple only for iOS. I think it's more secure. Other than that, iPhone X is a good phone. Everything is okay, camera is exceptional. Battery could have been better. Charging sucks with 5W charger in box. The worth is not beyond 60-70 K. It's just the brand and the import which makes it costly",06 Apr 2019,Good but could have been better,4.0 ,Junaid
