"5A is far better than this. Full screen display is a bogus thing. No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc. Lags within the first 5 days. Even hanged for a very short while! 3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging! Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%. Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!? Don't like MIUI. As usual no earphone. As usual small cable. As usual no gorilla glass. As usual no waterproof coating or anything. Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.",13 Nov 2018,Definitely a NO.,1.0 ,Palash Kumar Saha

The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.,13 Oct 2018,Extremely poor camera.,3.0 ,Amazon customer
"It's a very good choice on a small budget. I tell You Why... Screen - IPS Screen with HD+ (720*1440) Display , It looks very Nice Easy to read in Day Light. Note - Mobile screen has round shape (but screen shot has corners , IDK how) Battery - I have submitted screen shots about battery uses (It is without sim card) It took 19 hours, from 100 percent to 81 percent (with screen on 33 minutes and with no sim card) So in my opinion battery is decent enough for a day use Camera - I have submitted the photo sample . You can check in ti photos . these photos are taken in day light camera is good for day light shooting. Sound Sound quality is good, in Speaker as well as in earphone (Earphone is not provided with handset) Phone speaker is loud enough to fill a room OS and UI Comes with android version 8.1 üòä UI is Great , Easy to understand. It comes with some unnecessary pre-loaded apps which can be deleted (but not the MI apps) Network Calling I have used it in whatsapp calling only and the voice clarity was good, no issue. I will update my review after 1-2 weeks of use . Recommended ? Yes, Best smart phone according to the budget.",13 Oct 2018,A budget Smart Phone ‚ù§,5.0 ,Jitendra

"Redmi's value for money phone. Worth 5999 easily. Few weeks of usage so far. decent battery life. And stable phone. 2 GB ram not so much of a let down. But I don't play games on this phone.

Couldn't ask for more in that price range.",05 Nov 2018,Value for money phone,5.0 ,Amazon Customer
Worst phone. Hangs a lot. Very slow and sluggish compared to realme c1 and redmi 5a or even redmi 2 prime! Photo quality also worst front facing camera. Processor is very far behind in real life usage compared to snapdragon 450 in realme c1. Can't play pubg even in low quality as it hangs. Display is also not so large compared to realme c1. Please by honor or realme c1 or asus zenfone max pro m1 instead of this. They said after I purchased that I cannot return product for phones. So got my money wasted so please don't purchase. Display is also poor when watching video at start then recovers slowly. In general not a worthy phone at all by Xiaomi! It has become money minded.,07 Nov 2018,Worst Phone in this price range in this competitive world.,1.0 ,Virusrag
"One of the best phones in between these months. Battery life is very good, sound quality is perfect and picture quality is too good. Also it is not heating ;that's the best thing I liked a lot.Totally a perfect phone in a suitable budget for Indian people. In a single word for saying about this phone is COMPLETE PERFECT. The bill sent by Amazon or the seller is not very good quality so that in a damaging situation within warranty period may create difficulty. This is the one thing that I haven't get any answer yet.For this reason I don't give full rating.

"Well to be honest m disappointed with MI this time and m shocked actually. I have used mi devices a lot. Redmi note 3, note 5, and so on and currently have mi max 2 as well but this tiny phone redmi 6A is a big let down. Reasons below 1.the advanced beauty selfie mode with so called AI sucks until its bright sunlight daylight outside so the selfie lovers this is ain't a phone or a camera for selfish lovers in low light cabs pub bars etc for selfie lovers. 2.heating issue while charging is annoying. Especially with power bank in traveling in hand or pocket or even bike or car. 3.the unlocking screen thing is not smooth I have to swipe up multiple times not sure why or if its a problem with my cheap screen guard tempered glass unless the same dowrks fine with NY other devices 4.inky good thing is the speaker output and the sound. Just brilliant. Awsome 5.tiny style with good grip slim look and as a secondary phone or a phone for standard smartphone users and aslo for people with a little high age like people above 50s will be a great phone. 6.battery backup is fine for a day with 4g and WiFi fibuse at home. 7.thenese and scustomizations level as usual awesome. 8/neteork is fine and called voice quality is good too. 9.balcony color is good just that the finger print sensor would have made much more sense. 10.most importantly extra memory card slot saves you and also that 2 GB ram is not adequate.",26 Dec 2018,Nice but not great,2.0 ,Arunabha Saha

"Brought this mobile for my mom. Manily purchased it keeping budget in mind and my mom's a ability to handle a smart phone. Not regreting too much since the user is amateur. But, if you are an advanced user or a gamer kindly avoid this phone. There are few more options available if you can able to add few more thousands to your budget. Build quality is okay Display is okay, not that great. Keep in mind that you can only watch 720p YouTube videos only. Camera quality is not that great. Remember, it has got only 2GB ram, when running on Oreio and Pie 3GB is mandatory. So, you can notice moderate lag. Battery life is not up to the mark. It's only 3000mah battery. Can stand for one day if used moderately. Takes lot of time to get fully charged. The charger capacity is only 5volt and 1amps. Speaker volume is low and when you are on call it's moderately loud. Signal quality is good. If you are really tight on budget, please accumulate few more bucks and go for other options in the same price range other than this. This is purely ment for amateurs. Don't expect to play PUBG at full graphics with this phone.",30 May 2019,"Save some money, go for some other model.",3.0 ,Vivekanand Arumanda

A good choice for people looking for low budget phone.built quality is good and is light weight.Camera performance is average.good in daylight condition. Not impressive for low light. video quality is good and can record hd videos.sound quality is above average. Performance is very good but don't expect heavy gaming support. Expect battery life for a day usage and little more. Pros : Separate memory card slot. Potrait mode in front camera. Good battery backup. Impressive pricing. Cons : No finger print sensor. No potrait mode in rear camera.,25 Feb 2019,A good low budget phone.,3.0 ,Sam
I tested this phone completely and found it was having same basic processing issues because 2 GB too is also enought for browsing 3-4 apps still the apps were lagging when loaded and their startup time was also too much. Not so quite happy with the processor and RAM. Front camera is really good even in low lights. Rear camera is okayy. Sound quality us very bad. Phone has great looks and is sleek and light weighter. Less bezels gave it more attractive look.,13 Nov 2018,Great looks and front camera not other configurations,4.0 ,Shashikant Mishra

"The Redmi 6A is the cheapest phone the company sells and is one of the cheapest smartphones you can buy today. While looking at the spec sheet it's easy to feel like you are getting a great deal for the price, in reality, that may not be the case. In case of the Redmi 6A, the phone is very affordable but Xiaomi has cut corner in key areas such as chipset and memory, which results in rather poor everyday performance. The phone just feels ponderous to use and that's today. A year or two down the line it will likely be insufferable. That's a shame because some of the other aspects of the phone, such as the design, the display, and even the camera are actually pretty good. Had it been armed with a faster chipset, this would have been a good entry-level smartphone.",27 May 2019,Choose REALME,1.0 ,Ankit

"This Redmi 6A is a pretty much budget smart phone. But comparing the price, nobody should complain about the product. The phone is pretty much for regular users, who use their phones to call, do social networking, take occasional pictures and selfies. The processor is fine, but RAM is limited when compared to Android Oreo (8.0). The phone is sleek and has extremely good finish. The phone looks very goo. One can defnitely go for it, if budget is the factor. If you can increase the budget by 1K-2K, then Samsung M10 is much better choice though. Pros ----- 1. Very good looking 2. Comes with Anrdoid Oreo 3. Very sleek 4. Dual 4G sim, separate memory slot 5. Octa core processor 6. 2GB RAM 7. 3000 mAh battery CONS ----- 1. Average camera, but not poor Final verdict: Good phone for limited budget",01 Mar 2019,Affordable smart phone,4.0 ,Anisur R Mullick
"Pro: Definitely the price. The smartphone is cheap and offers a lot. It takes over relatively quickly data stored on clouds and has a simple user interface. The screen resolution is actually not unappreciated that this smartphone costs less than 6k. Genutz can be all (mine) go to Apps. From social media to video portals to streaming services. In Viellerlei respect I fall in the context of my use in this regard, Cons: Unfortunately, the processor seems to be a bit overloaded with regular usage. The apps take a bit longer to start and music hooks up at the beginning. Over time, the whole thing stabilizes and there are only occasional problems.",25 May 2019,Good deal,5.0 ,ADITYA SHEKHAR

"This is my first high value purchase from amazon and after reading so many negative reviews regarding product quality or delivery issues I am really surprised or may be I am really lucky. My phone arrived in one piece and very well packaged in a tamper proof packaging. only Issue was the delivery man who was a little rude. About the phone; I am supper happy having the phone in my hand. It is sleek design, fits in the palm perfectly for single hand operation. There are features, like face unlock and full screen mode which is really next level. Others may have experienced it in higher end phone but for me it was first. In the normal mode you can use ""Home"" and ""Back"" buttons, which is part of the display, (there are no separate buttons on the phone at the bottom, complete clean design). But in the full screen mode, the buttons disappear and give you full ""Full Screen"" experience. ""Home"" and ""Back"" actions are controlled through gestures which is wonderful for people like me who like to be nerdy and sophisticated. People who don't know, will keep scratching their heads, how to go back or go to home screen and think that the software is corrupted. But it gives extra layer of security to me. The face unlock simply unlocks your phone without indicating their is face unlock on the phone. There is ""Second Space"" which you can use to hide your important app data and files and chats etc. It unlocks with a separate pin created for the same. So use normal login for public profile and hidden login for private profile. Just use different pins for different logins. Navigation is smooth (even in full screen mode, which I am using normally and not the button mode). Just swipe to go to home screen or go back or switch between apps. It is MI phone so build quality is good. I am a person who likes to tweak his phone from inside out so looking forward to discover hidden features and make the best of this phone. Also, it has automatic brightness control mode which is default so while you setup your phone, the screen brightness may change to dim to medium. You can choose to set this to off after phone is setup. I hope you too enjoy your new Redmi 6A, I am just super excited. :) I am giving 4 stars because I rarely give 5 stars. So 4 stars means one of the best. I give 5 stars only when I feel service has been over over delivered. Although it is a very good product, and most importantly made in India I still think there is room for additions and improvement.",28 Oct 2018,Super Excited,4.0 ,S. B.

"Pros: 1) Decent Video/audio recording with minimum distortion. (noise cancellation is much much better than Redmi 5a) 2) Decent Camera for a budget phone. 3) good for Android smartphone beginners. 4) Can run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. 5) Fast boot. 6) Good touch response for a budget phone, I find it to extra sensitive. haha Cons: 1) Bad Video quality for watching movies/ you tube. But I use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me. 2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out. Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a. Ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.",25 Oct 2018,"GOOd budget phone, but...",3.0 ,Kk

But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis 1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone 2. Camera very very poor quality 3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.

"Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM. *My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be.

Believe me it fabulous product so far. The screen is apt and very clear. Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc. Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material. Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space. Phone is quite light weight and very smart.

If some one really wish to know which is better, 6A or 5A then i suggest to go for 5A only.",30 Oct 2018,Redmi 6 A - Speaker is not loud,2.0 ,Ram

"To say in short, its one of the best devices out there in it's price bracket.

Too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them & techies will be able to remove stubborn ones too via adb. 2. No IR blaster in 6A, i do use it a lot.

I had recently purchased MI 6A phone. But after 3 days of the purchase the phone started giving issues on the call quality. While the call is going on suddenly there is a drop of the voice where either side cannot hear each other. I did not expect this with MI phones as previous versions have been quite stable. This is unfortunate that the date of return is gone and now only the repair center will be doing the rest by taking another 15 days to fix the same.,13 Nov 2018,Worst experience with MI,1.0 ,yash

"My core requirements was a smart phone with a whatsapp in it, so I can always keep in touch with my parents without them much hesitating about how critical to use a new phone is. This certainly meets all the basic conventional requirements for the modern day era. Secondly the battery back up is quite decent with a 100 percent charge u can always browse and play with this phone for almost the entire day. In hibernation mode it should be atleast a 50percent more i.e 1.5 days without charging in between. Now, all u need is an internal memory card micro sd of atleast 64 gb because the inbuilt storage is quite less and wouldn‚Äôt suffice the load of data storage from hefty whatsapp groups let alone your music and photos. The face recognition works well however there‚Äôs a 2sec lag which shouldn‚Äôt be a very big deal provided the price tag of it.

Everything is fulfill your satisfaction. - Battery life is very impressive. - Phone feels premium in the hand specially it's very light weight. - Speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume but it's ok. - Design part I love it very much - Picture quality not highly impressive it's average quality they given 13 MP Rear camera | 5 MP front camera. - Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's rarely noticeable. - Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection otherwise if the phone fall from your hand then your phone maybe damaged. - For long time use this phone is hanging, it run 3-4 apps in the background without lag/hanging. - Video quality is not good for watching movies/ you tube. overall I like this.",19 May 2019,Best in this price,5.0 ,Shraboni

"Ordered the phone in the Amazon sale and eager to put a review on website. Here‚Äôs a detailed review with pros cons and ratings. Pros: + Good Build + Nice Display + Powerful Chipset + Lag Free Performance + No Heating + 2 Day Battery + Good Front and Rear Cameras + Quick Charge 3.0 Supported + Case Provided in the box + 3 separate SD slots ( 1 for Micro SD card + 2 for Sim card ) Cons: - Screen Size Bit small - No Type-C Port Ratings: Design: 8/10 Display: 8/10 Battery: 10/10 Back Camera: 9/10 Front Camera: 8/10 Processor: 9/10 Call Quality: 9/10 Sound from Speakers: 9/10 Sound from Earphones: 8/10 Pricing: 10/10 Overall Rating: 9/10 Detailed Review: Here‚Äôs what you get inside the box: 1. Handset 2. Charger 3. USB charging cable 4. Sim ejector pin Design: The design of Redmi 6A is slim and small, easy to hold it . The build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. Rating 8/10. Display: The display on the front is a Full HD 5.45-inch notch display with 18:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. It is covered with a 2.5D glass which gives it a premium look. The notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. I think Xiaomi could have done a bit better here. Small notches mean less space for notification icons so that‚Äôs not great. Rating 8/10. Battery: The phone comes with a 3000 mAh . So, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. One nice improvement in Redmi 6A is that Quick Charge 3.0 is available now. The phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. Rating 10/10. Audio: The speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. The audio via the earphone is average if you don‚Äôt tweak the settings. So, I‚Äôd recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. Rating 8.5/10. Performance: The Redmi 6 A runs on Android v8.1 operating system with 2.0GHz Mediatek helio A22 quad core processor is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. App opens and close fast. not good for Gaming as screen is small. If you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 32 BG variant. Rating 8.5/10. Security: Face unlock work well on the Redmi 6 A. No Fingerprint sensor. Face unlock takes a bit of time (less than 2 second) to unlock the device. Face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so don‚Äôt use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. Rating 9/10. Pricing: The pricing of Redmi 6 A was a bit of a surprise because it was available for Rs 5999 + Additional Instant discount during the Amazon sale of Rs 600. Rating: 10/10. Camera: With 13 MP rear and 5 MP front camera. The aperture and pixel size ( 1440 * 720 Pixels and 295 ppi pixel density ) has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. In earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations. The front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. The performance of front camera is good as well. Pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. The dynamic range wasn‚Äôt great though. Rating 8.5/10. Summary Overall, Redmi 6 A Pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 5999, we think it offers good value for money. If you have a budget of around 7000 - 8000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then Redmi 6 A should be your choice. If you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then you ought to raise your budget and go for a higher specification models. Which Color is the best? If you like to keep things simple, then go for the Black color. If you need something bright and flashy then go for the Blue color which looks really nice.

"So if you want to buy this product read the review and decide yourself. This review will getting little longer but after reading you will knowü§î everything about this! 1.Looks and Build:Trust me guys under 6k this is the best design no smartphone offering you this type of design yes its build is made of plastic but under 6k you cannot expect better than this. Even its plastic then also its feel solid yes it can take scratches easily so I will recommend you to buy a back cover for your smartphone. *Even mid range phone get scratches so easily*ü§£ 2.Camera: now camera is the thing which many people likes and dislikes but in my opinion under 6k this camera is best talking about the front camera it is even impressiveüòÆ the qualities actually true 5 megapixel.üòé And the rear camera according to price its decent not so good but not so bad it's actually work fine with this budget category phone.üòâ According to me you cannot expect more than this in this price.üëç 3.Batteryüîã: in today's smartphone battery is the major problem that it's not even last for a day but under the budget of 6k 3000 MaH battery is not bad. Under the moderate usage it can last upto a day.üóìÔ∏è Battery is pretty decent. Performance‚úåÔ∏è: this phone is powered by MediaTek helio a22 quad core processor which is clocked at speed of 2.0 gigahertz. And according to this price range this processor is good for this phone it can easily handle your daily work like social networking ,playing games medium graphic one, all other small works. you need to kept in mind that this phone price only 6,000 rupees so you cannot expect more than this. Now some people will say that 2GB RAM and 16GB storage is low and we cannot use this phone smoothly. But in my opinion if you want this phone for light use then this will not create problem for you. But for heavy users who wishes to play pubg on it That's not for you guys! ‚ò∫Ô∏è But you know the fun fact you can play pubg on low graphic setting on this device!üòÜ And also if you are that type of person who downloading apps and apps multiple apps on your smartphone Daily then this device is not for you. Displayüì≤: under this price range this display is best nothing to say anything more (Important):- I read many reviews on Amazon and people are saying that the smartphone is bad its sound quality is not good, its battery backup is not good, its build quality is not good. According to me they want more in this price range but in my opinion you cannot get this much in 6k! In last let's take my verdict: If you want phone for lite use Not for heavy purpose then this phone is made for you. But in any case if you want a little better smartphone then this you can pay 1500 rupees extra and grab the realme c1. Real me C1 is also good value for money option for you yes you can play pubg on it.",26 Jan 2019,Want To Buy?,5.0 ,V.I.P'$
"The hardware is awesome, with good display, camera and all... But the MIUI is a real TRAP. Reasons listed below. 1. Privacy: They have launched alternate apps for every Google Apps. They are constantly collecting user data. Be it via keyboard, their videoplayer, browser, cloud backup- anything. The only thing I wanted from redmi is hardware. But a lot of rubbish spying softwares also came along with it, branded as MIUI. The worst part is we can't even disable most of these, thus taking extra ram space. 2. Space: The MIUI and all the spying apps that comes along with these needs constant updates. And we can't disabl the updates. Soon all these heavy updates are going to take ur space- both ram and internal storage. And this is a dirty business tactics used by them to life their customers into buying a high-end phone the next time. Overall review: Hardware and config- above edpectation. Software- sucks.

It's been a month I am using this device in free time and I must say it's a smartphone with descent specs and good battery backup. Here are few pros and cons according to my experience: Pros: 1) Price- just ‚Çπ5999 bucks ! 2) Battery- it last about 1.5 day in light usage but less than a day in heavy usage. 3) Camera with EIS! - that's insane to have image stabilization on board at this price. Camera is descent and capture good photos but noise levels are high under low light conditions but HDR helps a bit to eliminate them 4) Looks & design- it's a personal opinion- this phone is comfortable to hold and looks great too! 5) Performance- it's good for light usage and low end games. Cons: 1) Battery- 3000mah is good but 4000mah should do great justice. 2) MIUI - full of adds and bloatware. 3) Not so smooth! - I encounter light to little lag while using this device. Also comes with Meditek helio a22 chipset which sounds fancy but average in performance. 4) Memory management- MIUI is heavy and leave around 800_900 mb of free RAM out of 2GB! Conclusion: I would recommend this device for those who are ok with the above cons or else go for Realme C2 to be launched within couple of days. P.S.

"Redmi has not worked on their camera for low light, hence picture quality at night stays poor. But picture in good light is great and worth appreciating for this price, the front camera has features like background blur and the beauty filter works well. It lags a little when you have a lot of apps active all at once. But I usually can play games seamlessly. The sound outlet is at the back. That is a really poor design idea because when you place your phone on the flat table or bed, it blocks the sounds from music players as well as ringtones. Sound is okay, not very loud. Just fine and doable. Battery life could have been better, but if you're not online all day or playing video games for hours, changing once a day is more than enough. Biggest problem I've faced is that the hotspot of this phone doesn't always work on my laptop. My laptop has never had any such problems with other phone hotspots.

My mom has been using the phone for past couple of days and she has not been taking any phone calls since then. No one in the house is even hearing the sound to pick when ringing. 2. 5A was much better than 6A in terms of screen size. Even though the dimensions of 6A is bigger, 5A has much better usability. ( Eg : The back button which is placed in 5A vs 6A ) . 3. The photos / videos app is too noisy that it confuse what we should do with it. 4. Too much of tracking / spam apps to advertise. 5.

Refreshing looks with rounded corner display & body. 2. Good build quality with metal body. 3. Nice 5.45 in HD display (1440 x 720 pixels resolution), 295 PPI and 18:9 aspect ratio. Good sunlight legibility. 4. AI gimmick (haven't tested it much). 5. Full screen gestures, yes in pros as i love them in my Redmi note 5 pro & having them in low end segment is nice. 6. No hybrid slot, three separate slots, so 2 SIM and extra memory at same time. 7. Dual 4g standby (enable it in settings - SIM cards & mobile network). 8. Android Oreo 8.1 out of box. Periodic security & bug fixing updates. 9. Promised upgrade to MIUI 10 (upgrade released) & also a major upgrade to Android 9.0 10. Plethora of sensors (except IR in specific). 11. Pretty decent camera (samples attached) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ CONS ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1. Performance may be a issue if you are coming from 5A. Having both devices right now, can say, this one is a bit on lower side compared to 5A as far as performance is considered. 2. No IR blaster in 6A, i do use it a lot. It's one the key features for me. 3. Helio vs Qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device. 4. Too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them & techies will be able to remove stubborn ones too. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ BATTERY BACKUP (screenshots attached) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Device status: Locked bootloader, max apps restricted for notification access & autostart, screen brightness medium, and location off.

"I have gifted this phone to my Mom...she has been using it for the last 4-5 months and she is quite happy with the handset, so here are the pros and cons she has experienced over this period of time - PROS 1.

Rear Camera is fair in well lit places but in low light conditions create some noise in the images but with flash it can be reduced to a certain level 3.

I was quite skeptical before buying this phone for my brother. I had read many bad as well as gud reviews about it so was quite confused üòï Finally I placed the order and bought it through Amazon. Believe me it fabulous product so far. The screen is apt and very clear. Battery life is very gud and lasts full whole day with heavy use by my son on games etc. Memory is 32 GB so lot of space for apps and other material. Infact in these days one shud not buy phone less than 32 GB memory as the no of apps we use are quite large in number and that itself consume huge space. Phone is quite light weight and very smart. I chose blue color and believe me it looks classy. Only issue it does not come with earphonesü§îü§îü§î I respect the adverse reviews of many customers as they might have faced some issues but I recommend this to all buyers.

I don't know if xiaomi will deliver regular security updates Verdict It's definitely a good phone for it's price also i just saw it's price increased 600 rupees so i would say if battery life is your highest priority and you can spend extra 1400 go for the realme c1.

A extremely bad experience from Xiaomi. The first from Xiaomi that is just terrible. The screen quality is bad and qorse the screen optimization is bad too. The P letter on keyboard doesn't work and rest of the screen works just ok. The screen audio doesn't gets bright enough and creates problems in sunny areas. The battery is worse and provides bad backup. The SoC Helio a22 is garbage. Just slows down every where & feels sluggish in simple tasks.

For everything else, this phone sucks. Picture quality of camera is decent, not very good. The screen quality sucks. Performance of the phone sucks too.

"A shout out aloud to Xiaomi for yet another great launch in their product basket. The phone not only looks elegant and trendy but can easily win the title of being an excellent performer. A quality phone packed with features is what if you are looking for, this is the perfect decision. CAMERA QUALITY: 13 MP, f/2.2, with LED flash, HDR, panorama. Video quality of 1080p@30fps. Value for money. The Redmi 6A performs better as compared to other phones in this price range. BATTERY LIFE: Redmi 6A is packed with 3000 mAh Non-removable Li-Ion battery. The battery performs well. Takes upto 1.45 hr to get to 0-100. Battery lasts for a day. For me, it doesn't gets heat. FACE RECOGNITION: Actually, it doesn't recognise sometimes I don't know why. I prefer PIN or PATTERN. NETWORK QUALITY: I have purchased Redmi 6A(32GB) last month (April 2019) For my mother. Till this time it works good. Network quality is very good. And calls are very clear. SOUND QUALITY (SPEAKER): Apart from above, I have only problem with speaker. It works well, but sometimes I think it should be louder (when phone rings). I felt this problem only when the phone is kept in bed. All together I love this phone. It is very cheap and performs well.",18 May 2019,BEST PHONE IN THIS PRICE RANGE,5.0 ,Darlin K S

"It is because of all these features and much more that I believe Redmi 6A by MediaTek's Helio A22 worth buying. It is also priced at just Rs. 5,999 for the 16GB storage variant and Rs. 6,999 for the 23 GB storage model! Redmi phones are definitely worth for what you are paying. Following are the features:- Display and Battery The Xiaomi Redmi 6A features a 5.45-inch IPS LCD HD+ display which exhibits a screen resolution of 720 x 1,440 pixels. The smartphone gets its required power from a 3,000mAh Li-Polymer battery which is not enough to deliver sufficient backup. The device comes with Blue, Gold, Grey and Rose Gold colour options. Camera and Connectivity The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is armed with a 13MP primary camera which can capture images of 4,128 x 3,096 pixels. Moreover, it can also record quality videos. A 5MP front camera is also present that helps to click mesmerizing selfies. In terms of connectivity, the smartphone comes with a lot of options such as 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, mobile hotspot, microUSB, and Bluetooth. Storage and Configuration The Xiaomi Redmi 6A houses a 16GB inbuilt storage which can be increased up to 256GB by using a memory card. Under the hood, a 2GHz quad-core processor is present that manages the overall performance of the system. Moreover, it is further accompanied by a 2GB RAM.

I bought this phone for my mom but I thought I should test it as my primary device for few days. After few days of usage here are first impressions of this budget phone: ‚óè Build Quality (8/10): It has a solid plastic build. It has rear curves slightly towards the edges which gives good grip on phone so don't worry about slipping phone from your hand. ‚óè Camera (9/10): 13 MP rear camera takes decent shots in daylight. The front camera is 5 MP with portrait mode feature which works on AI which does fairly good job. So selfie camera in general takes decent photos with beauty mode. ‚óè Display(8.5/10) : It has 5.4 inches hd LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes less bezels. Viewing angles are not that good but acceptable for two peoples. It performs average in sunlight keeping in mind its price. ‚óè Performance(7/10): This phone comes with Helio A22 chipset with 2 GB ram. Phone comes with so many pre loaded apps which you can disable. This phone sucks in multitasking. You can play small games on it. Xiaomi will improve it's performance with MIUI 10 update.(MIUI 10 Beta is already out and works fantastic) ‚óè Battery(9/10): It has decent 3000 mAh battery which gives you whole day power for moderate usage. Other specifications which are impressive at this price: 1. AI face unlock 2. Dual VOLTE 3. Dual sim slot + memory card slot Cons: No fingerprint scanner Overall rating : 8.5/10 With such a low price tag it is best mobile in the market. You can definitely buy it.
