There is no service center in kolkata. Don't buy coolpad devices. I searched Google and called every service center number I found. There is no service center for coolpad in west bengal and do not believe that MI or any other company do Coolpad's servicing. I called every number of coolpad found on Google and can confirm what I say is correct. Even asked other service centers whether they do coolpad or not and I was left disappointed. Just don't buy coolpad.

Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models. Camera: not as good as my Honor 7A, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me.

"I am writing this review after 2 days of using this phone. The Camera as per price is good, for sample I attached 2 photos click by this camera. Screen is also good. And it's latest Android-Pie So thats an advantage. But the best part I see in this phone that is its look and phone is very handy to carry. If you are searching a budget phone then please go for this phone. And if 2GB RAM is not sufficient for any one then he can use this phone as secondary phone, as its very handy phone, and if you use this for 2 days only you will not like any other phone for using.",25 Aug 2019,Most handy and good looks Budget Phone,5.0 ,Kunal Raina
